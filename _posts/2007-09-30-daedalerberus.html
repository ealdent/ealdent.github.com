I came across this dog costume on <a href="http://thegreenman.net.au/mt/archives/000479.html" title="the Green Man" target="_blank">the Green Man</a>.  I think Daedalus would look hilarious in it.  Last Christmas, we dressed him as Daedal the red-nosed reindog.  Just need to find some stuffed animals and someone who knows how to sew...
