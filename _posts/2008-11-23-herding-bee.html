<p>We took Willow herding yesterday.  There is a nice little setup near Cumming, GA that offers herding lessons for beginning and intermediate dogs.  We got three sessions in the circular pen with three sheep.  Willow did really well the first time and it seemed like her herding instincts had kicked in full-force.  She kept trying to get at the sheep afterwards, unable to rest as long as she wasn't in the pen.  The sheep got changed out and were replaced with three sheep who were more "dog-broke" (meaning, they were less afraid of dogs).  Willow, being a fearful girl with low self-esteem, didn't take to these sheep and decided it was better to run away.  So in the end, we had two failed attempts and one successful.  We'll probably head back in a couple weeks and hope for either more skittish sheep or a more confident dog.</p>

<p>After we got back, I took Daedal out for a walk and there were a bunch of deer moving through the woods.  I went sneaking after them and Daedalus was happy to oblige.  The bug was sniffing like crazy and making his typical beagle hunting noises, which did nothing for our sneaking.  I got a couple shots, none of them excellent.  But this one wasn't so bad.</p>
