<p align="justify">I'm not sure if anyone realized it, but Mike Huckabee, the governor of Arkansas, is running for president.  How do I know this?  His first campaign ad.  He has finally proposed doing what I've been saying do for years:  unleash Chuck Norris on the world.  Illegal aliens at the border?  Walker Texas Ranger baby.</p>
<p align="justify">So this election, would you rather have Chuck Norris protecting America or space aliens?  That's what I thought.  Vote Dennis Kucinich.</p>
