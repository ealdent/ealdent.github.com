<p align="justify">This past spring I worked on a morphological analyzer for Old English verbs.  To my knowledge, this has never been done using finite state transducers.  As part of my search to find the current state of the art for this language, I emailed Professor Richard Hogg at the University of Manchester.  He wrote the section of the Cambridge History of the English Language on Old English morphology.  A lot of times, you'll email a professor and it could take days for them to get back to you, especially if they are at a different university.  Sometimes they don't respond at all.  But, Dr. Hogg was a very polite and helpful guy, saying my work sounded interesting and pointing me to the <a href="http://www.arts.gla.ac.uk/SESLL/EngLang/" title="Stella - old english software and research" target="_blank">Stella group</a> at the University of Glasgow.  His section on morphology in the Cambridge History was also very helpful, so I felt quite grateful to the guy.  I wish I could have known him better.</p>
