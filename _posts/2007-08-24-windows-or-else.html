Movie pirate Scott McCausland must switch to Microsoft Windows as part of his sentence for uploading <em>Star Wars: Episode 3 </em>to a BitTorrent site.  This is blatantly unconstitutional and I'm amazed any judge would do this.  Here is the pertinent line from the constitution expressly forbidding this sort of thing:
<blockquote>
<h4>Amendments to the Constitution</h4>
<h5>Article VIII.</h5>
Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor <strong><em>cruel and unusual punishments</em></strong> inflicted.</blockquote>
