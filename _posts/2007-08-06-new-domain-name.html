Well, I have registered <a href="http://www.mendicantbug.com" title="The Mendicant Bug">mendicantbug.com</a> for this blog.  This is in part an effort to ensure I will actually stick to blogging this time.  I was slightly surprised the domain wasn't taken, though I probably would have been more surprised if it were.  The advantage of crackheaded naming.

I tried two other blog services before settling on wordpress to host this.  The option of just hosting it on a home computer was out since all we have now are laptops (a macbook and a pc).  I could have hosted it on my school computer perhaps, but that runs into issues when it comes to the fact that I don't actually own that computer.  So that left me with online services.  I tried out livejournal first, but that actually sucked pretty bad.  I'm not sure why anyone uses them.  Maybe if you have a paying account it's a little better, but that wasn't what I was looking for.  Next came Blogger/Blogspot, the current Google offering.  I liked that a lot, especially being able to add page elements to the header, footer and sidebars.

I settled on WordPress mainly because I liked the pre-built templates better.  I can edit CSS and play around with that, but at this point in my blogging experience, I'm just too lazy to do it.  Plus, after years of experience doing web design, the simple fact is that while I can make a good, clean design, other people are much better at it.  WordPress had pretty much whatever else I have wanted to find so far, save the ability to edit the footer.  But I also haven't looked very hard for that option yet, so it may be lurking somewhere awaiting the moment when I have enough time and inclination to find it.
