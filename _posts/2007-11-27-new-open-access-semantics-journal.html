<hr /><br />Original post can be found at:  <a href="http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2007/11/27/new-open-access-semantics-journal/" target="_blank">http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2007/11/27/new-open-access-semantics-journal/</a><br /><br />
<p align="justify"><a href="http://semprag.org/" target="_blank">Semantics and Pragmatics</a> is a new open-access, peer-reviewed journal focusing on the semantics and pragmatics of natural language.  While the journal isn't focused directly on computational methods, they expect to also publish material relevant to philosophers, psychologists and computer scientists.  Hopefully it will be more than the occasional submission that is of interest to CS people.  I'm looking forward to the first issue.</p>
