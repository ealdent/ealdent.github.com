I came across <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/media/magazine/15-09/st_pechakucha#" title="Wired - Pecha Kucha" target="_blank">this article</a> in Wired today about a new format for presentations called Pecha Kucha, which comes from the Japanese word for <em>chit-chat</em>.  It was invented by a foreign architect duo Mark Dytham (British) and Astrid Klein (Italian) living in Japan who saw a need for a way to showcase their work that blossomed quickly into a international fad.  Four years after its inception, there are Pecha Kucha nights in over 80 cities worldwide.

The idea is simple: 20 slides. 20 seconds each.  That's 400 seconds = 6 minutes 40 seconds.  The result is a sort of performance art that allows people to network and showcase their work.  Pecha Kucha seems to be bleeding over into the mainstream business world based on a couple of quick YouTube searches.   I think it should bleed over into the scientific.  I see two other places that would benefit greatly from it:

<ol>
	<li>Academic Conferences.   In addition to a poster session, include a Pecha Kucha session where 14 posters get presented in Pecha Kucha format.  Posters usually offer a more high-level view of some particular bit of research and so the Pecha Kucha is the perfect format for a quick presentation.  With fewer nitty-gritty details, this format would force the presenter to consider how best to present the architecture and underlying ideas so as to not bore the audience.  (Yes I am hoping for a miracle)</li>
	<li>Student Presentations.  How many times have I fallen asleep in student presentations where detailed algorithms or equations are displayed on the slide.  I don't learn well off of clunky slides presented in dull monotones or heavily accented speech.  Therefore, such slides shove me into a pitched battle of the eyelids with the constant fear of ambush by microsleep.  Speeding the presentation up and forcing the presenter to consider the flow of their presentation would be an enormous bonus.  Plus we wouldn't have to waste four class periods for 10-20 people to present their stuff.  It could be done in two.  I think Pecha Kucha forces the presenter to be more aware and more skillful in the design of their presentation which should actually improve their presentation skills far more than 80 detailed slides given in broken, unrehearsed mumbles.</li>

If you agree with me, talk to your department/supervisor and start changing things so that I don't have to have the Pavlovian response of falling asleep whenever I hear the word <em>presentation</em>.
