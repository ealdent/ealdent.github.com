Here is a word that has gone through the wringer in the past few decades.  Originally it meant <em>a monstrous offense</em> or <em>excessive wickedness</em> (American Heritage).  However, its similarity to the word enormous has caused it to be used by an ever growing number of people to mean <em>immense size</em>.  With all things language, attempting to turn back the natural tide of almighty <strong><em>usage</em></strong> is futile.  For example, the title of an article just posted on the National Geographic website is "<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/08/photogalleries/Angkor-pictures/index.html" title="Angkor's Ancient Enormity Uncovered" target="_blank">Angkor's Ancient Enormity Uncovered</a>".  I was disappointed when the story wasn't about a mass sacrifice or other such atrocity.
