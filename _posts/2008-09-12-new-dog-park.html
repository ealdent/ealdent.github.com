<p>Well, we have finally completed our move to Atlanta, GA.  It amuses me how each city in the US arranges itself differently.  Of course, this process can be traced by looking at the city's history, if you're really interested, but I'm not going to go into that further.  Whereas Pittsburgh was arranged into neighborhoods, Atlanta is like a star system.  At the center of the system is the city proper.  Radiating out from the center are numerous suburbs (planets).  We live in one of the northern suburbs, Alpharetta.  We are very close to a park again, which is nice, but so far we haven't found a dog park like Frick Park in Pittsburgh.  Our new dog park is a bit more strict about being off-leash.  Also, the off-leash area is a good deal smaller.  Another drawback is the prevalence of sand in the South, which means Willow gets it in her fur and then tracks it into the apartment.  We're still trying to figure out how to deal with that.</p>

<p>Despite these minor complaints, we're really enjoying our new place.  The location is amazing for shopping, which is a major plus for my wife.  It's also about one mile from my new job (for a rapidly growing software startup), which is a major plus for me.  If I want, I can walk through the park straight to my office.  I haven't quite figured out how to get to this trail, but I know it exists.  I'm going to try to find it tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>As for my new job, I will be mainly working on <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2008/08/14/opinion-mining/" target="_self">opinion mining</a>, which I have written about before.  I expect I will be writing about it a bit more here in the near future.</p>
