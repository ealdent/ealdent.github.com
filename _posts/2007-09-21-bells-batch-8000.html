Wednesday night I had the rare opportunity to go out to a bar and try some Bell's beer.  There was a special event run by the distributor where they gave away a shaker, a coaster and a pin if you bought their beer.  The shaker unfortunately featured the Oberon, my least favorite Bell's, but I'll take what I can get.  The bar was a pretty cool little place call <a href="https://www.fatheads.com/" title="Fat Heads Saloon - Pittsburgh, PA" target="_blank">Fat Heads Saloon</a>.  They had a bunch of decent stuff on tap and I got to try the Lagunitas Sonoma Farmhouse Hop Stoopid, which was a massively floral hop monster.  Fat Heads also has a custom Belgian Trippel made for them by some Belgian brewery I didn't recognize.  It was decent, but I'm always a little underwhelmed by Trippels.
