<p align="justify">You gotta hand it to <a href="http://www.killerbeanforever.com/director.html" target="_blank">a guy</a> who drops all his money to pursue his dream.  Even when that dream is a movie about a <em>baked bean </em>killing people with two dragon pistols.  This was done by the lead animator of Matrix Reloaded (Jeff Lew) and looks like it might be amusing.  Hard to say, though.  At the very least, I like to see people working outside (or on the fringes) of the Hollywood superstructure.  He was just the animator for Matrix Reloaded and the graphics were great despite the other problems the movie had.  Personally I liked it, but I know a lot of people view it as an abomination.</p>
