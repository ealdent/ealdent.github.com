There was a big thunderstorm this morning that totally drenched my feet.  However, in the darkness I did see something that I thought was quite cool.  The Cathedral of Learning at <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/" title="University of Pittsburgh" target="_blank">Pitt</a> with its crown shrouded in clouds.  Unfortunately my piece of crap cell phone doesn't do it justice.
