<p align="justify">Scientists have <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/12/sleep_deprivation" target="_blank">used a nasal spray</a> containing the brain hormone orexin A to wake up sleepy monkeys.  Three groups of monkeys were given a cognitive test:  alert monkeys, sleep-deprived monkeys given orexin A, and sleep deprived monkeys given a saline solution placebo.  The sleep-deprived monkeys given orexin A performed as well as the alert monkeys, while the placebo monkeys (control group) performed poorly.  They were deprived of sleep for about 36 hours.  Also, the monkeys given orexin A had PET scans that looked like the brains of alert monkeys.  Orexin A is non-addictive so doesn't run into some of the problems with other stimulants.</p>
<p align="justify">I have mixed feelings about this.  If it works in humans with no side effects (a pretty huge <i>if</i>), will the world of sleep be at an end?  Will we start working 80-hour work weeks?  Productivity certainly will increase, but so will consumption.  If we need energy for another 8 hours of activity, we'll probably have to add another meal.  Food production would have to increase proportionally, which will be felt all the way down the chain.  Oil consumption will increase, carbon emissions will increase from people driving at all hours, power usage will increase from additional lights/televisions/etc.   On the other hand, I have often felt that sleep is a waste of time and have resented the fact that my brain's performance degrades on lack of sleep.  I am not someone who naps peacefully, but begrudgingly and rarely.</p>
<p align="justify">That said, I seriously doubt this will work in humans and if it does, there will probably be dangerous side effects.</p>
