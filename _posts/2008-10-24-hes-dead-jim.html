Something about <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_1204.html" target="_blank">this photo</a> speaks to me:

<p>Now, I wonder if DeForest Kelley (Dr. McCoy) is really that interested in talking to the NASA engineer-looking dude on the left.  It just brings to mind hundreds of conversations between scientists and laymen where the laymen appears interested and the scientist rambles on about stuff way too esoteric to be meaningful.  Of course, maybe he's talking about his daughter:  "She's about yay tall..."</p>
<p>On a mildly interesting side note, I was trying to figure out the correct spelling of "yay" in the phrase "yay tall."  Is it "yay" or "yea"?  The Googles shows about 325 results for "about yea tall" and 821 for "about yay tall."  So I went with "yay".  Yay for me!  Anyone know which one the Queen uses?</p>
