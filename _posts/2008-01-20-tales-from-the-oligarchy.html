<p align="justify">There is a fine line between conspiracy theory and reasonable deduction.  Most would agree it is insane to believe that a group of elite men have existed since before the founding of the United States with the purpose of ruling the world from secret.  Most would agree that it is insane to believe that 9/11 was staged by people in the US government.  But there are all these little coincidences out there that hint at something deeper going on.  When we place them all side by side it seems almost reasonable to believe in the conspiracy theory, but the problem is that we have access to a limited set of the data.  If we sampled from the distribution of coincidences again, we might come to a completely different conclusion.  This is part of the difference between believing in a conspiracy theory and coming to a reasonable conclusion from the facts.</p>
So consider these "coincidences" [<a href="http://www.zcommunications.org/znet/viewArticle/16249" target="_blank">source</a>]:
<ul>
	<li>The owner of MSNBC and NBC is General Electric, who also owns Raytheon</li>
	<li>Raytheon is a defense contractor</li>
	<li>General Electric has a vested stake in Yucca Mountain</li>
	<li>GE and its affiliates have contributed to the main democratic contenders (Clinton, Obama, Edwards)</li>
	<li>GE and its affiliate employees have individually contributed nearly $70,000 to those candidates</li>
	<li>NBC has consistently excluded Kucinich from presidential debates</li>
	<li>Kucinich opposes the War in Iraq and opening Yucca Mountain</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">In the latest presidential debate, NBC stated its criteria for selecting candidates was being ranked in the top four.  Since Bill Richardson exited the race, much to my pleasure, Kucinich was now in the top four.  NBC extended him an invitation only to rescind it two days later.  Kucinich sued on violation of contract and won.  NBC appealed and Kucinich lost.  NBC claimed their first amendment rights were infringed by being forced to include Kucinich.  Corporations have first amendment rights?</p>
<p align="justify">So is it right to conclude from these series of "coincidences" that NBC and its corporate masters have conspired to affect the election by removing from consideration candidates who would not be financially beneficial to them?  Or is it a reasonable deduction to conclude from the facts that GE has a vested interest in making sure candidates who will support their goals are given media attention, which translates directly into votes?  If you will not agree with that, then surely you must agree that by excluding Kucinich, they materially affect the distribution of votes in the election.</p>
