<p align="justify">PhD Comics <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=967" target="_blank">does it again</a>.  Seriously, that is so spookily accurate, I need to get a credit check to see if someone has stolen my identity.  Minus the sports/celebrity gossip.  Substitute <a href="http://techmeme.com" target="_blank">tech</a>/<a href="http://gizmodo.com" target="_blank">gadget</a>/<a href="http://badastronomy.com" target="_blank">astronomy</a> news for sports statistics/celebrity gossip and you have me pretty much <a href="http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-toa2.htm" target="_blank">to a T</a>.</p>
