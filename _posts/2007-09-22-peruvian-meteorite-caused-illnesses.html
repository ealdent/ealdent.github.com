So the Peruvian scientists who examined the controversial meteorite have declared it is indeed a meteorite and it caused the illnesses reported by local residents [<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/09/070921-meteor-peru.html" title="National Geographic" target="_blank">source</a>].  The meteor hit an underground source of water that was contaminated with arsenic.  On impact, it ejected a blast of steam that affected locals who inhaled it.  Whether this will dispel conspiracy theories about this actually being an off-course Scud missile crash site, or fuel them, remains to be seen.
