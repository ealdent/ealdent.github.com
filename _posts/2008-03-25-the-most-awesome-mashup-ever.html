<p align="justify">So what sort of damage would you see if that low-yield nuclear device in your basement "accidentally" went off?  What if some government launched a very high yield device on another country?  <a href="http://www.carloslabs.com/node/16" target="_blank">Wonder no more!</a></p>
<p align="justify">The following pics are what would happen if "Little Boy" (the bomb dropped on Hiroshima) went off in my basement.  Followed by a 50-megaton, also centered on my place.  Lastly, what if the asteroid that theoretically killed the dinosaurs landed in my backyard?  Good stuff!  (The inner circle is the fireball, the purple is 3rd degree burns, the second and first degree.)</p>

<p align="justify">It looks like the sunburn (first degree burns) ring is inside the second-degree radius in the asteroid impact one.  Still buggy?</p>
