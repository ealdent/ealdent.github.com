<p align="justify">Well, <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hoAvkYTooNMqpzn8fF_3B76ko8eAD8UG8CQO0" target="_blank">Edwards is all set to announce he is dropping out</a> of the democratic race and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120167374629928257.html" target="_blank">Ghouliani has withdrawn</a> from the republican side.  Of the mainstream democrat candidates, Edwards was the least likely to become corporate lapdog of the year.  He had some unfortunate things against him, which made me less than <i>meh</i> about his bid, but I would have preferred him to Clinton or Obama.  My prediction is Obama will take it.  As for the Republicans, I was <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/11/28/oh-yeah-mccain/">terribly wrong</a> about McCain's prospects.  Which evil would be worse?  McCain or Romney in the White House?  I must say, though, I am so, <i>so</i> glad that Ghouliani was a miserable failure.  If he had been made president, the world would have been a much darker place.</p>

<p align="justify">At this point, no one is heading to the White House that I support.  I refuse to support the lesser of two evils and so will almost certainly be voting Green as a protest.</p>
