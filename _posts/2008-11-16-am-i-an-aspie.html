<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspberger" target="_blank">Aspberger syndrome</a> is a social interaction disorder that falls under the autism umbrella, but isn't accompanied by any delay in cognitive development.  I've considered the possibility that I have it a few times given the fact that I seem to have a lot of trouble in social situations.  However, based on the descriptions of Aspies, I think if I do have it, it's very mild.  I think this may be one of those cases where a simpler explanation is called for.  If you don't practice something (in my case, social interaction), how can you expect to be good at it?  It may even be a little insulting to people with real Aspberger syndrome to suggest that I have it.  Who knows, since I don't want to see a shrink about it.</p>
<p>So I took <a href="http://www.rdos.net/eng/Aspie-quiz.php" target="_blank">a quiz</a> and the results indicate that I'm very likely an Aspie.  Of course I have no idea how reliable the test is, not being a psychologist, but it was interesting.  There is also <a href="http://www.rdos.net/eng/asperger.htm" target="_blank">an edgy theory about neanderthals </a>espoused on a different part of that site.  So if you take the quiz, take it with the appropriate amount of skepticism.  I have admitted before that quizzes are my guilty pleasure.</p>
