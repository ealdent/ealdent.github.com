Erin McKean, the Dictionary Evangelist, has <a href="http://www.dictionaryevangelist.com/2007/10/perfect-example.html" target="_blank">a post today</a> on the coinage of the term <em>ygology</em>, meaning the study of palindromes.

Her take is that the word was an inevitability of English, demanding birth.  No argument there.

But then she also references ambigrams, which are visual representations of words that are somehow symmetric.  If you flip them upside down, they form the same word.  Or perhaps the negative space in the word forms another word.  Probably the most famous such figure is the cover of the book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGodel-Escher-Bach-Eternal-Golden%2Fdp%2F0465026567%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1192543957%26sr%3D8-1&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=ur2&o=1" border="0" height="1" width="1" /></em>.  She points to another site by  <a href="http://www.johnlangdon.net/index.html" title="John Langdon - ambigrams and more" target="_blank">John Langdon</a> that features a lot of really cool ambigrams -- definitely worth checking out.
