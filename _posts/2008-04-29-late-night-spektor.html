<p>NLP app idea:  construct random songs by scraping lyrics websites and stringing together common phrases.  It's a Pandora night for me and here were a couple lyrics that struck me as particularly meaningful.  Both by Regina Spektor, introduced to me by Pandora before she became (semi-)famous.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span><span> And then you take that love you made
And stick it into some
Someone else's heart
Pumping someone else's blood
- "On the Radio"</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><span><span> Beneath the stars came fallin' on our heads
But they're just old light, they're just old light
- "Samson"</span></span></blockquote>
<p>I love how she takes the beautiful image of stars falling on their heads and strips it bare of all romanticism and attached meanings, exposing them for what they are:  old light.</p>
