<div align="justify">George R. R. Martin is my favorite author and writes what I consider to be the best fantasy series of all time:  <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=song%20of%20ice%20and%20fire&tag=themenbug-20&index=na-books-us&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">A Song of Ice and Fire</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=ur2&o=1" border="0" height="1" width="1" /></i>.  Yes, better than J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis.  Whether you agree with that or not, if you like high fantasy, you will probably like Martin.  The 5th book has been a long time coming and still will be a while, but according to his <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/if-update.html" target="_blank">recent update</a>, we might see it published this fall.  He has also posted <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/if-sample.html" target="_blank">a new sample chapter</a> from the perspective of Jon Snow.</div>
