As I mentioned before, I spent last weekend with my wife's family in Dover, Pennsylvania (which is right outside of York).  We had a cookout and went to the fair.  Rather than posting a horde of pictures, I made this little montage.  The highlight of the fair was seeing an American buffalo calf being fed (row 2, column 4).  The thing was incredibly rambunctious -- the farmer clearly had a hard time keeping it settled for the dozens of hyper kids to come up and pet.   There were also some alpacas, sheep, goats, and -- of course -- pigs.<a href="http://mendicantbug.com/?attachment_id=135" rel="attachment wp-att-135" title="Weekend in Dover, PA Montage including the York Interstate Fair, a corn field, my dogs, my nephew (sort of), alpacas, pigs, goats, sheep, and flowers.">
