<p>According to Gartner, <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2008/040908-gartner-it-challenges.html" target="_blank">these will keep us busy</a> for the next 25 years.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Eliminate need to recharge batteries on wireless devices</li>
	<li>Improved parallel processing (at the PL and OS levels)</li>
	<li>Gesture detection</li>
	<li>Speech-to-speech machine translation</li>
	<li>Long term persistent storage</li>
	<li>100-fold increase in programmer productivity</li>
	<li>Identifying the financial consequences of IT investment</li>
</ol>
<p>I think numbers 1-3, 5, and 6 are almost certainly doable (though they all lie outside of my expertise).  Number four will at least make very long strides towards being widespread and easy to use.  I seriously doubt it will be perfect (and by perfect I mean as good as a trained  translator).  Number 7 I have no idea about, but getting management to understand the exact benefits of IT has been elusive for the past twenty-five years.  I doubt IT managers even have that kind of understanding about it.  There are so many variables.  As humans are made to become more and more slaves to their corporate overlords (i mean protectors), perhaps prodcutivity will become more predictable.</p>
