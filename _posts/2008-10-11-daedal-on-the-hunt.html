<p>Daedalus does a great job of finding where animals are or have been.  He tends to let the smells consume his attention, though, and he fails to notice when the animal scurries away, mere feet from him.  Today was one such day.  I watched the chipmunks he was pursuing all slip away to safer places.</p>

<p>If I watch this video with the sound turned on, it drives both my dogs crazy.</p>
