<i>No spoiler review. </i>
<p align="justify">Last night I watched <i>Beowulf</i>, the recent Robert Zemeckis version.  My review can be summed up simply:  it blew.  Hardcore.  Before it was over, I wanted to tear my eyes out.  And sadly, it is true that what is seen, cannot be unseen.</p>
<p align="justify">Tonight, Donna and I watched <i>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</i>.  Something I had heard as a kid about movies was that the longer the movie title, the worse the movie.  Nothing could be more wrong in this case.  What I say in this review should not be considered a spoiler, since the facts are a matter of historical record.  Plus the title gives away the crucial plot point, so it's not like you were going to be surprised when Robert Ford kills Jesse James.  I won't go into further details about the specifics of what happens.</p>
<p align="justify">What struck me as truly powerful in this movie was the development of Robert Ford's character.  Casey Affleck did a great job and deserved his Oscar nomination.  Brad Pitt didn't detract from the film, either.Â   I highly recommend it if you love westerns, though it wasn't really a western in the conventional sense.</p>
<p align="justify">At one point in the film, there is a guy in a bar singing a song that struck me as particularly cool.  Lo and behold, it is a real song:  "The Ballad of Jesse James."  Does it mean I'm getting old that I like folk songs so much?  I've included the lyrics below the jump.</p>
<p align="justify">Jesse James was a train and bank robber who killed at least 17 people.  He went by the name of Thomas Howard in order to escape the law.  While still alive, he inspired the popular media so much, people were publishing made-up stories of his exploits.  Children grew up idolizing him.  When he died, he was transformed into a Robin Hood figure.  The ballad portrays him as a man who stole from the rich to give to the poor.  What was it about him that so captured people's hearts and minds?  I think we can't resist the idea of that kind of freedom.  He was beholden to no man.  He had no boss and he thwarted the powerful.  He had his own cunning and skill and the bravery to use them.  He was a murderer and a thief, and people wished they could be him.  He is still famous over a hundred and twenty years after his death.</p>

<b>The Ballad of Jesse James </b>[<a href="http://www.contemplator.com/america/jessej.html" target="_blank">source</a>]

Jesse James was a lad who killed many a man
He robbed the Glendale train;
He stole from the rich and he gave to the poor
He'd a hand and a heart and a brain.
<i>Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children, they were brave;
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.</i>

It was Robert Ford, that dirty little coward;
I wonder how he does feel
For he ate of Jesse's bread and he slept in Jesse's bed
Then laid poor Jesse in his grave.
<i>Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children, they were brave;
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.</i>

Jesse was a man, a friend to the poor
He never would see a man suffer pain,
And with his brother Frank he robbed the Chicago bank,
And stopped the Glendale train.
<i>Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children, they were brave;
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.</i>

It was his brother Frank that robbed the Gallatin bank,
And carried the money from the town;
It  was in this very place that they had a little race,
For they shot Captain Sheets to the ground.
<i>Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children, they were brave;
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.</i>

They went to the crossing not very far from there,
And there they did the same;
With the agent on his knees, he delivered up the keys
To the outlaws, Frank and Jesse James.
<i>Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children, they were brave;
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.</i>

It was on Saturday night, Jesse was at home
Talking with his family brave,
Robert Ford came along like a thief in the night
And laid poor Jesse in his grave.
<i>Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children, they were brave;
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.</i>

The people held their breath
When they heard of Jesse's death
And wondered how he ever came to die.
It was one of the gang called little Robert Ford
He shot poor Jesse on the sly.
<i>Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children, they were brave;
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.</i>

This song was made by Billy Gashade,
As soon as the news did arrive;
He said there was no man with the law in his hand
Who could take Jesse James when alive.
<i>Poor Jesse had a wife to mourn for his life,
Three children, they were brave;
But that dirty little coward that shot Mr. Howard
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave.</i>
