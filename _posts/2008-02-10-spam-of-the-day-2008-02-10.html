<blockquote>"polyteny"</blockquote>
Definition:  the state where a cell contains all <a href="http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?polytene+chromosomes" target="_blank">polytene chromosomes</a>. [<a href="http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?action=Search+OMD&query=polyteny" target="_blank">source</a>]
<p align="justify">One common tactic in spamming is to use words whose frequencies in English are really low.  Frequent spamming words are easily detected and so if an email contains the words "viagra" and "pharmacy," the chances of it being spam are really high.  Words like polyteny, if they appear in any email, are probably in conversations between specialists.  The hope spammers have is that low frequency technojargon will not have been weighted as spam in whatever spam filter the message encounters.  In fact, this particular spam was one of the first false negatives gmail has let slip through in days.</p>
<p align="justify">Also, the SOTD idea is becoming a little boring to me, so I may discontinue it and only mention things that are particularly amusing.</p>
