<p>Michael Crichton died yesterday of cancer at age 66. Crichton was a favorite while I was growing up and was probably a big influence in my decision to pursue science as a career. I blazed through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006170315X?ie=UTF8&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=006170315X"><em>The Andromeda Strain</em></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=as2&o=1&a=006170315X" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345370775?ie=UTF8&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345370775"><em>Jurassic Park</em></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0345370775" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060891564?ie=UTF8&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0060891564"><em>Eaters of the Dead</em></a><em><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0060891564" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></em>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002STNQ2?ie=UTF8&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0002STNQ2"><em>Prey</em></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B0002STNQ2" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />, and others. I thought <em>Prey </em>was pretty cool in terms of exploring emergent behavior, though the level of suspension of disbelief was especially high.</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061015733?ie=UTF8&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061015733"><em>State of Fear</em></a><em><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0061015733" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></em>. It really played off my cynicism and I started looking into the possibility that the whole global warming thing was bogus. The more I looked, though, the more it became clear that it was Crichton's points that were bogus. At that point, I lost respect for him. Thinking back now, it's clear that one of Crichton's most common themes was the danger of science unhindered by morality and pursued without caution. That's a good goal, I think. Despite the fact that he went overboard railing against environmentalism, he managed to educate readers about science <em>while</em> keeping them entertained.</p>
<p>On balance, I think it is a good legacy.</p>
