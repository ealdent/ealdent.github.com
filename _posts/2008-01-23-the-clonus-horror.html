<p align="justify">A short while ago, I <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2008/01/13/the-island/">wrote about</a> the movie <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0399201/" target="_blank"><i>The Island</i></a> starring Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson.  The studio was sued by the makers of <i><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0078062/" target="_blank">Parts:  the Clonus Horror</a> </i>for copyright infringement.  A judge agreed that the case could proceed to court, at which point it was settled for a rumored 7-figure amount.  Netflix, in a moment of recommender system success, presented me with none other than this movie!  Fortunately for me, it was the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version.  As usual, it was hilarious and far more enjoyable than if I had watched this atrocious bomb of a movie with no commentary.</p>
<b>Spoilers</b> about <i>Parts: the Clonus Horror</i> and <i>The Island</i> are <b>to follow</b>.

<p align="justify">The amount of plagiarism involved in the writing of <i>The Island</i> is truly astounding.  I can't imagine that <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm1047021/" target="_blank">Caspian Tredwell-Owen</a> will ever work in Hollywood again.  His only other writing credit was <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0294357/" target="_blank"><i>Beyond Borders</i></a>, which starred Angelina Jolie and Clive Owen.  I never saw it and never intend to.  I guess he was chasing the success he felt after that movie and gave in to temptation.   I'll begin by cataloguing many (but my no means all) of the various similarities between these two movies.</p>

<p align="justify">The biggest difference between the two movies was that the main characters die or are lobotomized in the <i>Clonus Horror</i>. In <i>The Island</i>, the clones are set free in a triumphal exit from the facility -- completely lame.  <i>The Clonus Horror</i> had to end on a happy note, though, and the Clonus project was exposed and the presidential candidate was cast down (presumably).</p>
