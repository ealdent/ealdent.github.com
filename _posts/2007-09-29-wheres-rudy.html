Came across <a href="http://therealrudy.org/" title="the real rudy giuliani" target="_blank">this funny little video</a> asking the simple question, where was Rudy?  Rudy Giuliani had "scheduling issues" and so couldn't make it to the Republican Debate discussing issues pertaining to "Black America."  The video explains exactly what he was doing.

	<li>Evening fund raiser featuring Bo Derrick and Dennis Miller where he raised $100k.</li>

The video leaves you with the question:  "Where are his priorities?"   Well, obviously not with Black America.  And Republicans never really have bothered very much with Black America, so why start now.  For a party that supposedly opposes abortion, they do very little to help the segment of the population who is forced into having the most of them.  Black teens historically have twice as many abortions as hispanics and nearly three times as many as non-Hispanic whites.  Of course, that doesn't matter to Rudy either.

I sure hope this joker doesn't get elected.

Pete Wilson is a former Republican governor of California.  Why anyone cares whether he's endorsing a candidate is beyond me, though I suppose there are a few in California who might care.  Of course, there is no way in hell that Rudy will take California if he does get the GOP nod, but there you have it.  I guess the benefit is in helping him get the GOP nod in the first place.

So in my quest to find out a little bit about Pete Wilson, and I do stress <em>little</em>, I happened on <a href="http://video1.washingtontimes.com/dinan/2007/09/the_blessing_or_curse_of_pete.html" title="washington times - blessing and curse of pete wilson" target="_blank">this nice little piece</a> in the Washington Times about the blessing/curse of his endorsement.  Stephen Dinan reports that Wilson is often credited with turning California into a permanent blue state by alienating immigrants with Prop 187 - an evil little bit of legislation from back in 1994 designed to deny immigrants social services, health care, and public education.  It was struck down by the federal courts and Gray Davis later let the case drop.  However, it must make you wonder as a hispanic voter in California, whether any Republican can be trusted or is worth voting for.  Of course, Republicans haven't done much to change things since.

But I think Rudy getting Pete's endorsement is indicative of the kind of presidency we'd see from this guy.
