<p align="justify">Last night was the last total lunar eclipse for two years and it was quite good.  Pittsburgh weather cleared long enough for me to snap a couple shots of the unobstructed moon with Regulus (the brightest star in the constellation Leo) bright above it and Saturn even brighter to the bottom left.  There was still a light haze that I think made it difficult for me to get the focus right.  I was able to capture the rich, red color while the moon was still exposing a sliver of sun-drenched rock.  Then the clouds came in earnest and I was getting tired, so I went to bed, missing the full umbra.  But at least I got to see some of it this time.  Last time there was a <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/08/27/total-lunar-eclipse-blues/">lunar eclipse</a>, I was completely out of luck.</p>

<p align="justify">The next picture is slightly overexposed, but it's just plain cool to me, so I included here below the jump.  If you click on the image, you can see a larger version.  The moon is actually slightly dimmer in the bottom left (where the eclipse has begun) when you look at the enlarged version.</p>
