<p>I've taken to calling her <em>kitten</em>.  I was messing around with obscuring the flash.  This shot had the flash obscured by an opaque object.  I liked the look on her face, but the lighting was too low and led to noise in the capture.  So I hit it with the sepia and film grain.  The pictures are rather large, so I'm hiding them below the jump.<!--more--></p>

<p>This shot was taken by holding my finger over the flash.  The red tint is the flash through human flesh.  Thinking about how bright that is, I wonder if I should be worried about finger cancer.</p>
