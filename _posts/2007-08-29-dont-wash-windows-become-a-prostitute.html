A friend of mine sent me an <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSHER94576020070829" title="Reuters.com - window washing now illegal in Italy, thanks to those damn gypsies" target="_blank">odd story</a> about how Italian police officers are now spending their time:  stopping the heinous crime of washing your car windows at a stoplight.  At first, I thought, well that's a bugger-all odd thing to be concerned about (I always think to myself in incorrect, bastardized British slang).  Then it became clear:
<blockquote>"Foreigners are also blamed for much of the street crime in a relatively safe country. Most people wielding sponges on street corners are Romanian gypsies, often young women and children."</blockquote>
And there we have it.  The gypsies.  For as long as there have been gypsies, the good people of Europe have shunned them.  And now they have found one more way of making their lives that much harder.  Anyone caught committing this godless act (window-washing) is subject to confiscation of the tools of the trade (sponge, rag, dirty water), fines, and imprisonment.  The magnificent mayor of Rome justified these draconian regulations:
<blockquote>"People must realize that behind the window-washers there is exploitation of minors, which is a crime. Like prostitution this is a racket that must be smashed."</blockquote>
I can just see him banging his fist down on a podium as he says that last bit.  So now window washing is on the same level as prostitution, which is exactly what these gypsies might have to resort to if they want to eat.
