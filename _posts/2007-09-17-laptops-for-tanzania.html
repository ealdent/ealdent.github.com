My friend <a href="http://www.wheresmystapler.net/2007/09/freealertorg-laptops-4-tanzania.html" title="Where's my stapler?" target="_blank">Israel</a> is trying to raise $2000 to buy laptops for young people in Tanzania.  Tanzania is a country of over 35 million people, but only 15,000 graduated high school in 2004.  Of course giving money would help him out, but another way to help him would be by voting for this cause on Facebook via the Razoo Speedgranting Campaign.  This gives you a free way of helping them raise money and it only takes a minute of your time.
