<p>A phrase that has been bouncing around in my head lately takes the general form:  "If wishes were X, we would all Y."  The problem I've been having is that I can't remember what X and Y are.  After a brief googlevestigation, I came up with two prime candidates:</p>

<blockquote>If wishes were horses, we would all ride.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If wishes were fishes, we would all cast nests.</blockquote>
<p>The phrasing of the second part is flexible.  One of my random candidate Xs was "butterflies" (because I like <em>die Schmetterling</em>) so I looked into that as an option and happened upon (of unknown origin):</p>

<blockquote>If wishes were butterflies, we would never see the sun. [<a href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Lane/2470/butterflies.htm" target="_blank">source</a>]</blockquote>
I like that.
