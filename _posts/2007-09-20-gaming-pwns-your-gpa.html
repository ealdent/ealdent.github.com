Well big surprise, but a study has shown that students who game get worse grades.  Obvious, right?  The study, as reported by <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070920-deathmatch-video-games-vs-study-time-a-flawless-gpa-victory.html" title="Ars Technica - Gaming hurts GPA" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a>, actually set out to see if the amount you study affected your grades.  The experiment was carried out at Berea college in Kentucky -- a religious school in a dry county, so presumably alcohol consumption is not a major factor in the lives of these students.

To boil it all down, male students who gamed had GPAs (grade point averages) that were 0.24 points less than other students and coed roommates of someone with a gaming system saw a hit of 0.13 points.  What's interesting to me is the distracting influence a gaming roommate has.  As Ars Technica points out, this could influence universities and parents both.
