<p align="justify">I just attended a wedding yesterday and have been without Internet for way too long.  Interestingly, my <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/11/09/you-have-no-soul/">last post</a> became wildly popular on both <a href="http://digg.com/offbeat_news/You_Have_No_Soul" target="_blank">digg</a> and <a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/url/mendicantbug.com/2007/11/09/you-have-no-soul/" target="_blank">stumbleupon</a>.  That post has more than doubled the total traffic of all time to my blog, bringing it to over 10k hits.  As of the writing of this post, the post has gotten 4,060 hits today alone, about 550 yesterday and 990 Friday.  Crazy.  Thank you, whoever put up that sign.  On a side note to anyone who might be wondering, CMU uses blue cannisters for recycling.  There isn't normally a cannister in that location and people were standing around it the past couple days before it, so anyone who passes through there on a regular basis would know not to use it.  Some funny comments on the post and on digg.</p>
<p align="justify">Anyhow, at the wedding, the best man gave the traditional toast.  The couple being married had dated for about 10 years, so it was a pretty special wedding to a lot of people.  The best man made the point that, in marriage, it's easy to fall in love with somebody, but a happy marriage comes from growing that love.  As your love grows, you'll look back and see your wedding day as the day you loved each other the least.  He concluded with the following line (my paraphrase since I can't remember exactly):</p>

<blockquote>"May the best day of your past be the worst day of the rest of your life."</blockquote>
It got a round of laughs, but it's also a great way to put it.
