According to <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/09/26/dogmatch_ani.html?category=animals&guid=20070926120030&dcitc=w19-502-ak-0000" title="Discovery Channel News - Dogs and people" target="_blank">a report</a> by Discovery Channel News on a new study, the personality of the dog shapes the human-dog relationship far more than the person's personality.  It turns out that the key to a good human-dog relationship is that the dog be generally agreeable and open to new things.  Maybe this is why I love Daedalus so much.  He's always up for any adventure and will let you do anything to him (though he may squirbble a bit if he doesn't like it).  My nephew Dillon used to pull on his ears and skin when he was a bit younger (Dillon is just over a year old, fyi) and Daedalus tolerated it perfectly.  He's such a good dog.
