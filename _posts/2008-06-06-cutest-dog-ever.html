<p>I just noticed that on the first page of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=1G1GGLQ_ENUS245&q=cutest+dog+ever&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi&oi=property_suggestions&resnum=0&ct=property-revision&cd=1" target="_blank">Google Image results</a> for the query <em>cutest dog ever</em> is none other than the <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/12/03/old-christmas-tree/" target="_self">Daedalpuppy</a> (reposted below).  The first picture on that list is pretty cruel.  :P  I think Daedal has those other dogs beat.</p>
