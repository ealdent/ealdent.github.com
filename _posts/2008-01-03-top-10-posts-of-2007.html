<p align="justify">Perhaps it's a little late to do a recap of my blogging from last year, but I was just thinking about which posts I made that were the most popular and which flopped.  It was very interesting to me that the most popular ones tended to be those I invested myself in the least.  The ones where I felt like the writing and/or content was the best saw relatively few hits.  There are exceptions, of course.  My favorite post almost made the top 5 most popular list and the 4th most popular would be in my top 10 or 15 favorite.  So here are the top 5 most popular posts and my top 5 favorite posts from 2007, my first year in the blagoblag.</p>
