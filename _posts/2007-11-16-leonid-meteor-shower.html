<p align="justify">This weekend will be the peak time for the Leonid meteor shower.  It is so-named because the meteors originate from the section of the sky corresponding to the constellation Leo.  The most locateable star in Leo is Regulus, which rises these days just after midnight on the eastern horizon.  A little while later, Saturn rises behind it.  Saturn and Regulus are both fairly bright so they make an easy pair to spot.  The sky map below is from a perspective of Pittsburgh, PA at 1:51 am tonight (November 17, 2007).  Peak time for the shower will be around 4am tonight and tomorrow night. [<a href="http://www.space.com/spacewatch/071116-ns-leonid-preview.html" target="_blank">source</a>]</p>
<p align="justify">Of course, you don't have to find the constellation Leo in order to enjoy the Leonids.  The comet Tempel-Tuttle leaves a trail of dust as it orbits the sun and occasionally we stray right into it.  In 1833, the event was so huge people from Europe and North America took note of it.  Estimates of the storm activity put it at over 200,000 meteors per hour!  I dream of such a thing.  It even led to the song "Stars Fell on Alabama."  Another big storm occurred in 1866 and again in 1966.  Unfortunately, it looks like this year will be a modest viewing year, which puts the Leonids lower on the totem pole than the Perseids, which occur back <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/08/13/beautiful-bolide/">in early August</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">Viewing conditions for Pittsburgh look grim, which is typical of this time of year.  This morning we had our first real snow.  It had snowed a week or two ago briefly, but that was more of a snowy drizzle/wintry mix.  Today there was actually accumulation on the dead leaves in the yard and on some cars.  Nothing major yet.</p>
