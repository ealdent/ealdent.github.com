<p align="justify">Whenever I hear the word <i>enormity </i>used to describe how gi-freakin-normous something is, I always willfully misinterpret it to mean <i>an act of extreme evil or extreme wickedness</i>.  Now before you start screaming prescriptivist and throwing Kleenexes drenched in the snot of sociolinguistics at me -- I'm not being a prescriptivist.  Of course people have the right to use <i>enormity </i>that way.  It is certainly the trend for that word and it probably will be within my generation that almost everyone forgets its original meaning.  I just so like the meaning of extreme wickedness that I want to be able to use it to mean that without being misinterpreted.  And a lot of people only know that word to mean <i>gigantic</i>.</p>
<p align="justify">So I was listening to a promo video (below) by Richard Branson of Virgin Galactic.  Branson opens up with this line:</p>

<div align="justify">
<blockquote> "Astronauts of the past 45 years have all returned to Earth struggling to convey the <b>enormity</b> of what they have discovered and with their perceptions clearly changed."</blockquote>
</div>
<p align="justify">And quite frankly, the sinister music blends with my interpretation of enormity far better.  Astronauts have all returned overwhelmed by the vast wickedness they encountered in space.  Awesome!  I totally wanna go now.  Actually, I've always wanted to go and probably would go even if I was told I had a 50/50 chance of making it back alive, so enormity just ups the thrill level.</p>
