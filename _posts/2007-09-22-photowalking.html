Robert Scoble posted <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/09/22/wonderful-rules-for-photowalking/" title="Robert Scoble - photowalking rules" target="_blank">a link</a> to Thomas Hawk's blog post on photowalking.  The premise is simple:  make your camera a part of you.  I find this very difficult, because I feel like cameras offend people in most situations, annoy them in others and are just generally touristy otherwise.  A camera phone on the other hand doesn't give me quite the same feeling, though I do struggle sometimes.  I need to get over this.

The principles of photowalking are simple.  Hawk goes into much more detail and <a href="http://thomashawk.com/2007/09/principles-and-guidelines-for-modern.html" title="Photowalking guidelines - Thomas Hawk" target="_blank">his post</a> is worth reading.  To summarize, the rules are as follows:
<ol>
	<li>The camera goes with you everywhere</li>
	<li>Take pictures everyday</li>
	<li>Share your work and join a community</li>
	<li>Be engaged in photography social networks</li>
	<li>Never hesitate (in taking a shot)</li>
	<li>Shoot in RAW and photoshop it</li>
	<li>Know your rights: where it's ok to shoot and where it's not</li>
	<li>Art is more important than rules</li>
	<li>Money spent on gear is always worth it</li>
	<li>Back up your photos</li>
	<li>Learn to shoot in manual mode</li>
	<li>Shoot with a group of people (it's safer)</li>
	<li>Get used to using a macro lens</li>
</ol>
So now some of these are way more technical than I ever get, especially since a 2 megapixel cell phone camera is my current primary camera.  Obviously not sufficient for a serious photographer.  If only I had more money to devote to this hobby, it's something I've always wanted to spend more time doing.  Maybe after I get my Ph.D.
