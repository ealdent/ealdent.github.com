Ok, I feel the need to plug a <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook</a> app.  First of all, most apps suck.  They chew up space on your profile and are largely useless because for them to be any good you need like a dozen friends using them, which never happens.  There are a few exceptions, like <em>Books</em>, which is cool on its own (though I wish adding new books were a little easier).  However, one app that really impressed me is Dogbook.  Dogbook lets you create profiles for your dogs.  Your dogs can have their own friends (other dogs and people) and pictures added from your profile.  Also, you can search for dogs in your area, so if you were ever wondering who owned that dog you met in the dog park, now you can (assuming they use Dogbook too).  This is especially useful since people hardly ever exchange names at a dog park and you only know them by the names of their dogs.

And surprisingly, a large number of people seem to use it.
