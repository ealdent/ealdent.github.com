<p align="justify">Giuliani and Clinton are both faltering as the early primaries approach.  <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/12/04/poll-shows-clinton-giuliani-down-big/" target="_blank">According to CNN</a>, Giuliani is down 9 points while Clinton is down 11.  Huckleberry Hound is in second place for the Republicans, leading the has-been McCain, the ridiculous Thompson, and the irrelevant hypocrite Romney.  Meanwhile, Obomba is a distant second for the Sheepocrats with Edwards trailing at an even more distant third.  And of course, the principled candidate Kucinich is not even mentioned.  The poll in question has an error of +/- 5%, so it was pretty small.</p>
