<p align="justify">It snowed yesterday enough to cover the ground, but freezing rain turned to rain overnight and it was all gone by morning.  It's back to flurrying today and there was one stretch that was particularly beautiful as the snow was whipped around by the wind.  It could have been a blizzard if it lasted for more than 10 minutes.</p>

<p align="justify">That picture came out better than I expected, actually.  I've had difficulty in the past getting snow to show up on film and be anything more than a gray fuzz in the air.  I used flash with the "action shot" setting on my camera.  Speaking of cameras, I need a new one.  This one is going on four years old.  And I guess film is the wrong word there since this is a digital camera, so what I would call it?  Showing up on silicon?</p>
