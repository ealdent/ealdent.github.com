<p>While travelling to York, PA yesterday to visit my wife's family, I spotted a large moth under a pine tree.  Daedalus was sniffing around the tree and this bright orange thing caught my eye.  It was very lethargic, so I imagine it was either sleepy (since moths tend to be nocturnal) or about to die.  My guess is the latter.  I was able to snap a few shots and one actually turned out.  Autofocus kept slipping off of it.  Were the patterns in the wings maybe confusing it?</p>
<p>This particular specimen wasn't as large as these Giant Silkworm moths (aka <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyalophora_cecropia" target="_blank">Cecropia moth</a> or <a href="http://www.wormspit.com/cecropia.htm" target="_blank">Robin moth</a>) can get, which is about a six inch wingspan.  But it was big.  What a beautiful creature.  I love the fern-like antennae and the speckled wings.</p>
