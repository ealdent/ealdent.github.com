While driving home today from a dog event (which I may post pictures from in a bit), I saw this great bumper sticker:
<blockquote>"America is a Christian nation, which is why we don't have any homeless people."</blockquote>
Well put.  And if you squint really hard, you'll see that bumper sticker in the upper left corner of the back window of this blue Cooper Mini.

I also happened on another bumper sticker at the same time that I thought my friend <a href="http://wrathfuldove.org" title="The Wrathful Dove" target="_blank">John</a> would really appreciate.
