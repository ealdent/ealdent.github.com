Israeli startup <a href="http://www.zlango.com" title="Zlango - icon based language" target="_blank">Zlango</a> is taking a different approach to mobile messaging and emoticons.  Rather than using words that often are absolutely meaningless and incomprehensible to people unfamiliar with the orthographic conventions of texting (e.g. "idk", "myob"), they have created an icon-based language that would theoretically be comprehensible to anyone.  So here's an experiment.  Without looking at the Zlango site, what do you think this sentence says?
<p><img src="http://www.zlango.com/show.img?id=18" border="0" /> <img src="http://www.zlango.com/show.img?id=240" border="0" /> <img src="http://www.zlango.com/show.img?id=44" border="0" /> <img src="http://www.zlango.com/show.img?id=188" border="0" /></p>
Keep in mind there is not a one-to-one correspondence from icon to word (that is, there may be more than one word per icon or more than one icon per word, and words or icons may be dropped).  Of course, Zlango only has about 200 icons, so you are really limited on what you can say.  However, it appears they are going to be adding a feature to create your own icon.  If people start to use this and add their own icons, we could see a wiki-like explosion in the number of things that can be expressed.
