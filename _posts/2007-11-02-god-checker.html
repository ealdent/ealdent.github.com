<p align="justify">Norse and Greek mythology have always interested me.  I've also had a bit of an interest in Egyptian mythology, but never pursued it in depth.  So finding a good resource that makes finding about mythologies from all over the world really makes my day.  <a href="http://godchecker.com" target="_blank">Godchecker.com</a> has a whole slew of mythologies including Aztec, Incan, Mayan, Australian, Baltic, and the list goes on.  Quite cool.</p>
<p align="justify">A lot of the information, especially for the lesser known gods/mythologies is light, but if you ever wanted to know who the God of Passion in Eastern European mythology was, look no further.  Yarilo arrived on a white horse and ready for action.  Plus the site incorporates a bit of humor into the posts.  For example, from the post for <a href="http://www.godchecker.com/pantheon/greek-mythology.php?deity=APOLLO&ds=N" target="_blank">Apollo</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"Sudden deaths are not uncommon when he is around — and don't try to compete with him musically. It's all very well to be played alive but not flayed alive like poor old Marsyas. Or to be given the ears of an ass like poor old King Midas. <a href="http://www.godchecker.com/pantheon/greek-mythology.php?deity=CASSANDRA">CASSANDRA</a> never got another chance either, nor was he very pleasant to the <a href="http://www.godchecker.com/pantheon/greek-mythology.php?deity=SIBYL-OF-CUMAE">SIBYL-OF-CUMAE</a>, granting her immortality but leaving out the age clause."</blockquote>
So, fun and informative.  Good times.
