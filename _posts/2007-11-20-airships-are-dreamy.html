<p align="justify">I have a secret love affair with airships.  Ok, maybe not so secret.  They are in a word, awesome.  I wish airships from movies like Stardust or games like Final Fantasy were a reality.  I've always thought they would be the coolest machines ever built.  I have a special place in my heart for complex machinery made out of wood, rope, and brass.  This is the essence of steampunk technology to me.</p>
<p align="justify">So the Zeppelin may <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/11/zeppelin-could.html" target="_blank">come back</a> to San Francisco.  <a href="http://www.airshipventures.com/index.php" target="_blank">Airship Ventures</a> is a company that hopes to bring commercial airship tours to the US by fall of next year (the stress is on <em>hope</em>).  The rides won't be cheap -- about $250-$500 a pop.  Also these airships are more like blimps.  They are built by Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik (Airship Technologies) in Germany.  Already, they are used for tours around the world.  There are a bunch of pictures on <a href="http://www.zeppelin-nt.de/pages/E/bilder_u_thum.htm" target="_blank">their website</a> along with a set of draconian copyright rules that prevent me from posting one on my blog.</p>
