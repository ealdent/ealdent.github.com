I love reading an innocuously titled science piece and then coming across an absolute gem like this:
<blockquote>"Australian and French scientists have made another breakthrough in the technology that will drive next generation computers and teleportation."</blockquote>
<em>Teleportation</em>?

Quantum teleportation as it turns out.  Which is much different from the conventional teleportation featured in <em><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051622/" title="The Fly - old version with Vincent Price" target="_blank">The Fly</a> </em>or the transporter from <em>Star Trek.</em>  Quantum teleportation deals with transmitting the state information of a qubit from one location to another, which I don't even pretend to understand.  So was this just sensationalism on the part of the University of Queensland?  Or do I just get my hopes up when I see <a href="http://wordpress.com/tag/real-sci-fi/" title="Real Science Fiction">sci-fi brought to life</a>?
