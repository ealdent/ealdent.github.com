More sad news from the Endless War.  The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/16/world/middleeast/16iraq.html?_r=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin" title="Single largest attack of the Iraq War" target="_blank">New York Times</a> is reporting at least 250 dead in an attack on two Kurdish villages, Qahtaniya and Jazeera.  As they always do, these numbers will surely rise.  As of the time of the Times report, at least 40 obliterated homes had not been searched for casualties.

Reading these stories is enough to make you weep.  They also report on a Kurdish woman stoned to death by her own people for dating a Sunni man.  Sunnis then killed 26 Kurds in response.  And then to hear the US Ambassador spin it:  “This indiscriminate and heartless violence only strengthens our resolve to continue our mission against the terrorists who are plaguing the people of Iraq.”  They are plaguing Iraq because we brought them there.  As long as we are there, they will continue to plague Iraq.

It's time to leave.
