<p align="justify">The snow continues here.  Today it was covering the road.  When I took Daedalus and Willow out in the morning, they both weren't having any of it.  Daedal balked at the door and Willow was stepping gingerly and obvious wondering what had gone wrong with the world.  They finally got used to it, though the poor boy was shivering his butt off after a short while.  Willow was more in her element.  We're gonna have to get him paw gloves.</p>
<p align="justify">Here is the scene out my office window.  They are currently building the new <a href="http://gatescenter.blog.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science Complex</a> here.  One of the buildings is the Gates Center.  You can actually see shots from the <a href="http://gs3020.sp.cs.cmu.edu/~webcam/" target="_blank">live webcam</a> 24/7, though the show is quite boring after about 4:30pm or so these days.  What's amazing to me is that people are out there working right now.  In South Carolina, construction work ended as soon as the sky darkened and rain fell.  If snow fell, it would be like the end of the world had come.  I don't think this makes them any faster, though.  Another bizarre difference between construction crews here and there is that there are no hispanic people here.  This is a very bad thing as it also means there's crap for Mexican food.  You could find good Mexican every time you turned around in SC.</p>
