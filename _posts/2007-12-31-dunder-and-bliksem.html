<p align="justify">Among the several online comics I read on a regular basis is the <a href="http://www.saturdaybulletin.com/" target="_blank">Saturday Bulletin</a>.  It's a great comic that takes an old-timey picture and reinterprets the content.  So <a href="http://www.saturdaybulletin.com/?p=336" target="_blank">today's comic</a> is of Santa tromping off over a hill in the snow, saying "mmm... venison."  Blitzen isn't feeling so good about it.</p>
<p align="justify">The thing that struck me was that it referred to the reindeer "Donner" as "Donder".  <i>Donner </i>is the German word for thunder and <i>Blitzen </i>is lightning.  I knew this from my time learning German so it made complete sense and seeing "Donder" struck me as a mistake.  I have heard children say "Donder" before, so I thought this was a production mistake bleeding over into adulthood.  Lo and behold, Donder is the older version of Donner's name (<i>Donder </i>being an older spelling of the German word).  Originally the pair of reindeer were the Dutch forms Dunder and Bliksem.  Check out the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus%27s_reindeer" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry</a> and the <a href="http://www.donder.com/" target="_blank">Donder home page</a>, an amusing campaign to restore the name of Donder.</p>
