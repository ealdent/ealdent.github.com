<p>The spammers have been working hard to infiltrate Facebook.  I just got this (below) today, and it tripped my mental spam alarm.  These sorts of messages were commonplace on Friendster.  I would get messages from girls with near-pornographic profile pictures wanting to chat or asking me inane questions like which was the better hair color.  This is more insidious.</p>
