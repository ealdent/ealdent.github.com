<p align="justify">The current omnibus package for 2008 does not provide funding for many of the science programs that were promised in the America COMPETES Act passed last August.  If something doesn't happen, it will mean less funding for the NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science for this fiscal year.  In turn, innovation in science in America will continue to slip compared to the rest of the world at a crucial time.  So if you support science funding, please take 30 seconds to fill out <a href="http://www.congressweb.com/cweb4/index.cfm?orgcode=apspa&hotissue=77" target="_blank">this letter to your representatives</a> in government (senate, house, president) urging them to increase funding for these agencies this year.</p>
Please help keep me in a job! :)  [<a href="http://scienceblogs.com/principles/2008/01/do_something_about_science_fun.php" target="_blank">hat tip</a>]
