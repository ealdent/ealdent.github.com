<p align="justify">Google Reader recently added some social networking features.  You can now add your friends' shared items to your feeds.  Up til now I haven't used the shared items feature since it didn't really make sense to send people a link to my shared items and expect them to give a crap.  Now it's easier to subscribe to it and the decision to give a crap is left up to them when they read their feeds.</p>
<p align="justify">As Robert Scoble <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/12/15/workaround-for-google-readers-suckage/" target="_blank">pointed out</a>, there is one major flaw with the new feature:  it clutters up the rest of your feeds.  This is, of course, assuming you read your feeds in the "All feeds" folder.  I usually don't since I have a number of Tech News feeds that I'm not always interested in and often has duplicated information.  I only read it when I have time.  You can do the same with your friends shared items, so no big deal to me.</p>
<p align="justify">So why not check out <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/shared/17046708387443013211" target="_blank">my shared items</a>?  As it happens, I have none at the moment.  But if you use Google Reader, feel free to add/invite me so we can view each others.  I'll accept any invitations.</p>
