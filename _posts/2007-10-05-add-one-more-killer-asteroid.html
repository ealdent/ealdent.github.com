Another potential killer asteroid was rediscovered after being lost since the 60's.  Revolving around the sun once every 4.7 years, this asteroid isn't a threat for the foreseeable future, but if the orbit shifts, that could change.  It's just one more to keep an eye on, joining a family of 886 objects larger than 500 feet across that pass within 4.6 million miles of Earth, <a href="http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/071005-asteroid-found.html" title="New killer asteroid found" target="_blank">according to</a> Space.com.  Good times.
