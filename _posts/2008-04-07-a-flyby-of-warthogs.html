<p>I have no idea why, but four A-10 Warthogs made several circuits around the skies of Pittsburgh today.  They are quite noisy, subsonic jets used by the military against armored vehicles and ground positions.  The last time I had seen one outside of an air show or museum was when I was kid camping in Sumter National Forest in South Carolina.  A couple A-10's from a local air base were doing some target practice.  Their tank-busting guns sound like a giant dumpster slamming from far off.  At first, we had no idea what the sound was coming from, so we joked it was the lizard man.</p>
