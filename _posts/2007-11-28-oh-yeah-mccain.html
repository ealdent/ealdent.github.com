</p><p align="justify">I sometimes forget John McCain is running for president.  The guy came in second last go-round (2000) against W, but this time he just can't seem to get his foot out of his mouth.  CNN is reporting on a <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/11/27/poll-florida-republicans-oppose-making-abortion-illegal-gay-marriage-legal/" target="_blank">Florida poll</a> that puts him in a distant third (tied with Fred-freakin-Thompson) to Giuliani's fairly decisive first.</p>
<p align="justify">Time to drop out, buddy.  Time to hang that crazy hat on the walls of Congress alongside John Kerry and Joe Lieberman.  Yeah the media collects your soundbites when you beat on the empty drums you collectively call your heads, but no one is listening.  You may now join the ranks of the Marginalized.</p>
