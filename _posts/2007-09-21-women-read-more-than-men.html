I came across a story on NPR today about why <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14175229&sc=nl&cc=es-20070921" title="Why women read more than men" target="_blank">women read more than men</a>.  They quote from Louann Brizendine who wrote the book <em>The Female Brain</em>.  The issue of gender differences and the brain always starts fights.  Men have larger brains and more gray matter, which handles information processing.  Women have more white matter and thus more interconnectivity between parts of the brain.  The prefrontal lobe in women is more densely packed with neurons, and that is the area responsible for judgment, planning and language.  Here is a quote from the article:
<blockquote>"Girls have an easier time with reading or written work, and it's not a stretch to extrapolate [that] to adult life," Brizendine says. Indeed, adult women talk more in social settings and use more words than men, she says.</blockquote>
Woah nelly!  Brizendine hasn't been doing her reading, because tons of <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004689.html" title="Language Log - Male and female college students equally talkative" target="_blank">contrary evidence</a> to this crap has been out for a while.  And trying to find that link, I discovered that Language Log has already done a pretty <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004885.html" title="Fiction gap real or imaginary?" target="_blank">extensive commentary</a> on this article.  When it comes to matters of language, it's hard to scoop them.  The long and the short of the Language Log commentary is that the so-called gap in fiction sales could be accounted for entirely by sales of romance books.

So why is it ok for Brizendine to say that women read more because of biological differences but it's not ok for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_H._Summers" title="Larry Summers - Wikipedia" target="_blank">Larry Summers</a> to say that perhaps there are biological differences that account for the lack of women in engineering?  Does it not amount to about the same thing?  A very informal study (that is, just what I've noticed) gives me the intuition that there are fewer men pursuing English degrees than their used to be.  Looking solely at enrollment data for California State University Sacramento, the ratio of males to females pursuing English degrees (English, Creative Writing, Teach English as a Foreign Language) is about 1:2 and is trending slightly downward since 2002 [<a href="http://www.oir.csus.edu/Reports/FactBook/MGE/ENGL.cfm" title="California State University Sacramento enrollment in english data" target="_blank">source</a>].
<p><img src="http://ealdent.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/percentmales.png" alt="Percentage of males pursuing degrees in English at California State University Sacramento" /></p>
<p align="left">Compare that to the ratio of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University in 2005 and men outnumber women 3:1.  But in English departments, it appears there is a biological explanation, as Brizendine tries to show.  If we believe that, is it really such an unthinkable leap to say that biological differences account for the lack of women in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) fields?</p>
<p align="left">Honestly, I don't know.  I know many females in my program who are way better at math than I am.  Going through high school I couldn't say the same thing.  That seems to be anecdotal (and therefore unreliable) evidence that this is a cultural thing, because the females in my program are almost all from China or India, whereas the females I encountered in high school were predominantly American.  However, the population I am exposed to now was selected from a much, much different distribution than in high school.  Presumably math background is a heavy factor in acceptance (though they do accept a few of us who leaned more towards linguistics).</p>
<p align="left">This question is so muddled with emotion and propaganda, political correctness, heresy and hypocrisy that I think the real answer will be very difficult to come by.  People lose their jobs if they try to claim that there is a biological reason for women appearing less in STEM fields.  A 2006 report from the National Academies made the case that the reason is social, but the make-up of the panel was so stacked against the biological position that the outcome was obvious [<a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/36781.html" title="Math on the x-y axis" target="_blank">source</a>].  I'll conclude with a quote from this <a href="http://www.reason.com/news/show/36781.html" title="math on the x-y axis" target="_blank">Reason magazine article</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="left"><a href="http://darwin.nap.edu/books/0309100429/html" target="_blank">The report</a> [by the National Academies] endorses the view that the predominance of men in scientific fields is due not to biological differences and personal priorities, as [Larry] Summers suggested, but to gender bias and unconscious institutional sexism. But is this an effort to find out the truth, or to stamp out heresy?</p>
 The makeup of the panel that produced the report is revealing. Chaired by University of Miami President Donna E. Shalala, who is known for her commitment to feminist causes, the panel included a number of strong proponents of the belief that women in science are held back primarily by sexism and that aggressive remedies to these biases are needed.

Noticeably absent were proponents of other viewpointsâ€”including such female scientists as Vanderbilt University psychologist  <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/members/benbow.htm">Camilla Persson Benbow</a>  or Canadian neuroscientist  <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/%7Edkimura/dkhome.htm">Doreen Kimura</a>,  who argue that biological sex differences influence cognitive skills in some areas.
