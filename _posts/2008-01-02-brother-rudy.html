<p align="justify">Good ole Rudy Giuliani is up to no good.  His recent television spot is nothing short of evil.  I'm sorry, but when you blatantly use FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) for political gain, you might as well announce your intention to become a tyrant.  He's apparently using the political playbook of Goebbels.  By simultaneously portraying muslims as vicious animals and Iran as a warmongering nation led by a madman, this ad is a <strike>masterpiece</strike> clumsy bit of propaganda.  I hate to think that people are stupid enough to believe him.</p>
