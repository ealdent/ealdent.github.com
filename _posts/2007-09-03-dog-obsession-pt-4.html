Daedalus is a sucker for some good sunbathing and stick-chewing.  When he should be doing his business, he likes to plop down on some warm grass, grab a stick, and then proceed to gnaw it down until he almost chokes to death on it and I have to rescue him.  Once he had a stick jammed between his teeth at the back of his throat and I had to reach in and break the stick in his mouth.  This harrowing escape from death behind him, he proceeded to try to grab the shreds of the stick I had just shattered in his mouth and chew some more.

The cute little blighter.

Of course, I exaggerate a bit here.  He has never actually come close to choking to death on a stick.  The worst that has happened was as I described above, where the stick got caught in his teeth.  He also occasionally gets it caught between his teeth and his cheek, which is difficult for him to remove, but by no means life-threatening.
