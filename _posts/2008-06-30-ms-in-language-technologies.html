<p>I just completed the final requirements of my <a href="http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/MS/" target="_blank">Masters degree</a> today (the details of which I will save for a future post).  It has been a difficult road, and I'm glad it's done.  I didn't attend any sort of graduation ceremonies, because I don't go for that sort of thing -- at all.  Until today, it didn't feel like the weight was off my shoulders.  Now I actually feel like celebrating!  But I won't, because I'm a nerd.  I'm currently celebrating by working on a programming puzzle.  And surfing the blagoblag.</p>
<p>I still have a couple months of servitude to complete the requirements of my fellowship, but the degree is mine.</p>
