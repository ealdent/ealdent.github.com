When I hear a number like 3828, it doesn't sound all that high.  I mean, that's a fraction of the number of people who died in Vietnam (about 60k, including missing), which was a small fraction of the number who died in World War II (14+ million).  And those are just the American and allied <em>military </em>casualties.  The numbers for the opponents and civilian casualties dwarf those.  But 3828 <em>is</em> a big number.  Each one a person with a family, many with children, most of them with living mothers who will mourn them.  Each one had a life at home, dreams.

Obleek.com has <a href="http://www.obleek.com/iraq/" title="animation of coalition casualties in iraq" target="_blank">a very nice flash animation</a> that helps bring this home by animating the coalition deaths as they occurred by day from the start of the Iraq War until 13 February 2007.  Data used to create the animation was taken from <a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/" title="Iraq coalition casualty information" target="_blank">icasualties.org</a>.  Worth a look and a thought, perhaps.
