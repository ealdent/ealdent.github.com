<p align="justify">I'm swamped with homework so my blogging is limited.  I feel compelled to post <em>something</em>, though, like a moth to a flame.  A friend of mine sent me a link to the <a href="http://inmotion.magnumphotos.com/essays/chernobyl.aspx" title="Legacy of Chernobyl" target="_blank">Legacy of Chernobyl</a> the other day.  Truly one of the saddest things I've ever seen.  It's easy to forget about it after so many years here in the West, but people still suffer.  <a href="http://englishrussia.com/?p=293" title="slide show of modern day Chernobyl" target="_blank">Chernobyl</a> itself is open to tours and has been vandalized extensively by a French artist (though <em>vandalism</em> is not the right word, <em>decorated</em> may be better).  It's real-world scene of the end of the world.</p>
