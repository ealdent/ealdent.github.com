<p>Donna and I went to Settlers Cabin Park today just west of Pittsburgh with my friend Eric and his fiancee Julie.  The dogs came along and we cooked out and had a nice little picnic.  After going on the <em>teepee trail</em>, I came across a woolly bear caterpillar.  I've always found these caterpillars really interesting, because they look so <em>freaky</em>.  People raise them, since they turn into Isabella tiger moths, which are a pretty-ish speckled beige.</p>

<p>After returning home, the dogs were wiped out, which is exactly what we were hoping for.</p>
