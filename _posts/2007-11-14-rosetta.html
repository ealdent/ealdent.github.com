<p align="justify">The second fantastic photo of Earth from space I've come across in as many days was taken by the Rosetta comet probe sent up by the European Space Agency (ESA).  The Rosetta craft made big news recently when it was mistaken for an asteroid that was going to make a near-Earth pass.  The <a href="http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/mpc.html" target="_blank">Minor Planet Center</a> failed to cross check the object against known probes and so sent out an alarm before realizing their mistake.  Rosetta is using the Earth as a slingshot to propel it into the outer solar system (4.4 billion miles) to the Comet 67/P Churyumov-Gerasimenko.  After that it will return to Earth for another gravitational slingshot.</p>
