<p align="justify">The first (somewhat) serious snow came today.  Well, not particularly serious, but compared to South Carolina where I've spent most of the last 22 or so winters, it would've shut down schools for two days at least.  Daedalus acted a little prissy.  He didn't want to get his paws cold I guess.  He got used to it quickly and went exploring.  Willow had no problem with it.  She loves the cold.  The wind was gusting and that was more than the Bug could handle.  I wish I could've taken a picture of his face.  Normally getting him to come in is a hassle, but a quick "let's go" and he was running for the door.</p>
