<p align="justify">My longtime friend over at the <a href="http://wrathfuldove.org/2008/02/05/super-tuesday/" target="_blank">Wrathful Dove</a> has an excellent post today on the lack of <i>superness</i> in this so-called Super Tuesday, and I wanted to give it a plug.  Here is a brief excerpt that I thought sheds light on the charade that we call "elections" in America:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">I was reading the “issues” section of the Atlanta Journal Constitution on Sunday where there was an entire article devoted to comparing the musical selections of the candidates to see what exciting insights this exercise might provide. The same article also subtly observed the importance of selecting a candidate who seems likely to win in November, effectively reducing elections down to the horse race terms in which it is often framed in the corporate media.</p>
These elections are a sham and an obscene circus.
<p align="justify">Every four years the American public gets to select its master-in-chief from a narrow field of candidates who fiercely compete and debate within a very narrow range so as to give the illusion of choice and dialog while keeping the true options fixed to those acceptable and profitable to corporate America.</p>
