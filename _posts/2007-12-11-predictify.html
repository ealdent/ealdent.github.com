</p><p align="justify">I wrote about <a href="https://www.predictify.com/registration.aspx?BATCHID=291" target="_blank">Predictify</a> a while back.  It's basically a website that pays users for predicting world events.  When I <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/10/08/predict-this/">first wrote</a> about them, I presented the sample question:  "How long will Michael Vick's sentence be?"  Well, the verdict came down and my prediction was very close.  I predicted 24 months and the dirty bastard got 23.  Total payout for me:  $6.07.  Not bad for 30 seconds effort.</p>
<p align="justify">The site appears to be doing well.  Currently, there are 24 open polls with large cash payout potential.  I was pretty skeptical it would succeed (and that still has yet to play out fully), but it would seem that the guys who predicted its success are going to be looking at nice payouts of their own.</p>
