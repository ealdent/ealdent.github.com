<p align="justify">I just got back from watching Cloverfield.  There are very few movies so interesting to me that I will actually go by myself to see them.  I had tried to get a friend to come along, but he complained of "homework" and other such nonsense, and Donna can't handle anything with monsters in it.  Without spoiling anything, I will say that the movie was absolutely freaking awesome.  It was definitely a brilliant new take on the classic monster movie.</p>
<p align="justify">Since this is my blog, let me just rant quickly:  people who bring six-year-olds to movies like this are bad parents.  You're just not a good parent if you do this.  You are bad.  And stupid.  You may think your kid can handle it, but you are wrong.  And stupid.  Ok, back to the movie.</p>
<p align="justify"><b>Spoilers follow.</b>  I am putting a preview here to take up space on the page to prevent you from accidentally reading further if you don't want to see the spoilers.</p>

<p align="justify">The movie consists of camcorder footage taken primarily during one night in Manhattan.  It is often jerky and not getting the shot, like you would expect a real person to take.  It's basically one long, uncut YouTube video.  The effect is that for an hour and 20 minutes or so, I completely forgot where I was.  I was running next to these guys as they made their way through dark subways, leaning high-rises, and streets filled with dust.  It was truly a brilliant piece of work.</p>
<p align="justify">It was also really short.  Sometimes this is better with movies that are as intense as <i>Cloverfield</i>.  You just can't handle your nerves being on edge for much longer without it becoming troubling.  <i>I am Legend</i> was far more intense and there were points in that movie where I was almost not able to tolerate it.  In the end, the mystery of Cloverfield is still wide open.  There is plenty of room for sequels, and I sincerely hope the powers-that-be restrain themselves.  Was Cloverfield an ailen?  A government project?  Something from the deep?  Knowing will probably only be a disappointment.</p>
