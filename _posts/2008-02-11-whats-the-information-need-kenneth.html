<p align="justify">When you go to a search engine, you have an information need.  There is something you are searching for that you can only articulate imprecisely and you do so in a few words.  People are good at determining if something satisfies their information need, but not so great at stating it clearly. Librarians are trained to elicit this information need from you, by force if necessary.  (Just kidding, librarian mafia, don't hurt me!)  Their method is a dialogue where they probe the various aspects of what you are searching for, what you are <i>not </i>searching for, what you already know about it, etc.</p>
<p align="justify">A search engine can't engage in this dialogue, yet, but think about how you interact with a search engine.  You start off with this information need (at whatever degree of vagueness) in mind and probably compose a short 2-3 word query.  How often do you do one word queries?  We've been trained by search engines that this rarely succeeds unless it's a low-frequency word (or a brand name or jargon).  Our first query brings up some useful stuff perhaps, but usually we see that we weren't thinking clearly about our information need and we begin honing it over the next couple queries until we find what we need.  Some people are better at forming this mental picture and stating clear queries from the beginning [<font color="#0000ff">citation needed</font>], but most people need to narrow it down.</p>
<p align="justify">These queries we use for Google are often purely keyword queries, though sometimes we use slightly more sophisticated queries with <code>link:</code> or <code>site:</code> (etc) operators.  You can make sure terms are included with the + operator and excluded with the - operator.  You can even use wildcard operators (*) which can be nice (but also touchy).  What you can't do are structured queries.  You can't search for things like <code>(nice or sweet) and (man or guy)</code>.  You can't search for words that co-occur in certain spans of documents (like 50-word windows).  These things can be very helpful to an experienced researcher and having this ability over a web corpus the size of Google's would be enormously helpful.  Unfortunately, the computational and storage costs of such a thing are much higher.</p>
<p align="justify">So my question for you, reader, is would you even use this?  Would this be used by very many people or just the odd few researchers, paralegals, etc?  Computationally, I think Google could handle this.  The problem would come from the larger index to handle supporting such queries.  Even this would probably not be unreasonable for Google at this point.  So... why not?  My guess is the cost of doing such a thing (moderate to high) versus the customer demand (low to nil).</p>
Am I wrong?
