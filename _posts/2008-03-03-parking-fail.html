<p align="justify">Perhaps you've seen the "FAIL" meme that's going around the tubes.  If not, search on google images for "epic fail" and you'll hit it soon enough (I won't link to them).  Basically it's a bunch of pictures of people screwing up or things built wrong or whatever.  In short:  failures.  So tonight when we parked outside of a restaurant and our parking meter said this, I had to get a shot.</p>
