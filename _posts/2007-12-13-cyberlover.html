<p align="justify">Reuters is <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20071213/wr_nm/russia_internet_dc" target="_blank">reporting on</a> a Russian website, <a href="http://cyblover.ru" target="_blank">CyberLover.ru</a>, which has made a chatbot that supposedly can romance women in chat rooms into giving up their digits.  Unfortunately, the whole thing is in Russian, so I can't evaluate it.  I am really curious what sort of output this thing gives.  I think it also points out just how desperate people in chat rooms are to connect with someone.  Assuming, of course, it actually works.</p>
