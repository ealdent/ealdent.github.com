So a lot of websites are posting their kids in their Spiderman outfits or an array of really cool pumpkins or <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/10/31/internet-giants-compete-for-the-ugliest-halloween-logo/" target="_blank">just changing their logos</a>.  Me?  I stick to dogs.  This lady brings a mastiff around school all the time and today she had him dressed up as a flying monkey from the Wizard of Oz.  She was dressed up herself as the Wicked Witch of the West.  Not a bad outfit on a monster of a dog (who is actually quite sweet).
