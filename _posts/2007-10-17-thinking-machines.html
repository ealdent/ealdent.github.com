<p>If you've ever played a computer at a game of chess, go, checkers, or whatever, you've probably wondered just what the computer was thinking.  Sure you know intellectually that it can consider many times the number of moves you can in the same amount of time.  But what does it dismiss and what does it look at further?  How does it decide what a good move is?  Of course, it depends on the system and the game and is rather complex.  I have only played around briefly with trying to program such a thing.  I wrote a program in C++ to play checkers that looked three moves ahead (via depth-first search) and judged the merits of a move based on the points left on the board at the end.  That was back when I was first learning C++, so the code was very sloppy and I didn't really have a clue what I was doing.</p>
<p>But on one of my random journeys through the interwebs, I stumbled upon <a title="awesome chess visualization" href="http://turbulence.org/spotlight/thinking/chess.html" target="_blank">Thinking Machine 4</a>.   It's an online game of chess versus a computer opponent.  The board is very modern looking, with polygons as pieces.  Once you make a move, lines begin springing up all over the board, indicating moves the computer is considering.  Depending on how hard it has to think (that is, how many possibilities it must consider), lines are thin or thick as new ones spring up.  When the computer is not thinking, the board has a cool little optical illsuion to make you nuts.</p>
