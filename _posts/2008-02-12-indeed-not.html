<p align="justify">It doesn't inspire confidence in a <a href="http://www.indeed.com/" target="_blank">jobs posting site</a> when you get <a href="http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=psycho&l1=&q2=rapist&l2=&q3=serial+killer&l3=&q4=republican&l4=&q5=democrat&l5=&q6=journalist&l6=&q7=time+traveler&l7=" target="_blank">results for job salaries</a> like this:</p>

<p align="justify">I must admit, I am surprised.  I thought for sure being a Republican paid better than raping people, or at least paid the same.  Time travelers have an unfortunately low salary.  Obviously, they are too stupid to realize they could be hocking artifacts from the past for millions.  Oh well.</p>
