<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareidolia" target="_blank">Pareidolia is </a>the psychological phenomenon where people think they see some significant pattern or image in something random.  This may be the face of Elvis in pork chop grease or <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4034787.stm" target="_blank">the face of the Virgin Mary in a once-bitten sandwich</a>.  I have a coaster on my desk and an almost unempty glass of ice water, which is sweating profusely.  When I lifted the glass, I was surprised to see a little pareidolia of the smiley variety.  Incidentally, the 26th <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/09/18/x-25/" target="_self">birthday of the smiley</a> was just a week or so ago.</p>
