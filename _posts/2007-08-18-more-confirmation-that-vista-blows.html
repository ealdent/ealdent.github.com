Well, the now-former editor-in-chief of that great citadel of Microsoft-brown-nosing <em>PC Magazine</em>, is now <a href="http://digg.com/microsoft/PC_Mag_Editor_Throws_in_the_Towel_on_Vista" title="PC Mag editor swears off Vista - Digg link" target="_blank">swearing off Vista</a>.  You know when Microsoft's lackeys begin jumping ship that something is wrong.  This should certainly convince anyone if the fact that most businesses are reluctant to switch to Vista or that China will use XP for computer systems relating to next year's Olympics.

I love this quote from the Olympics tech guy at Lenovo:
<blockquote>"At the Olympics, we need the most reliable and stable systems." (<a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=300688&source=rss_news6" title="vista at the olympics" target="_blank">source</a>)</blockquote>
That just says it all.
