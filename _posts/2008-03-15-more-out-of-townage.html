<p align="justify">This time I'm in Ohio, so no new posts for a little while.  One thing I'd like to note, if anyone wants to leave a comment on this blog, I normally approve it.  The exception I make is no valid email address.  You don't need a website, but I want an email address.  You know who I am, after all.</p>
