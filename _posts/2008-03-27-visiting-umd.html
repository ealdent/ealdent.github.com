<p align="justify">My blogarrhea has tapered off over the past few weeks due to a number of time constraints, stress, and anxiety.  The wikipedia article for graphomania actually suggests blogging may be a form of graphomania.  Currently, I'm visiting the <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu" target="_blank">University of Maryland</a> tomorrow to take a look at the (cs) grad school and the <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/research/CLIP/" target="_blank">CLIP</a> (Computational Linguistics and Information Processing) laboratory.  So maybe I won't blog anything for a couple days or maybe not.</p>
<p align="justify">Anyhow, here are two views out of my hotel room of illustrious Silver Springs, Maryland.  The direct view out is the roof of a Whole Foods.</p>
