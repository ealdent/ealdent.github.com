Just the other day I was discussing upcoming conferences with my friend Eric.  We were lamenting the choice of location for the 2008 ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) conference in Columbus, OH -- my hometown.  At least I can stay with family (assuming I even go).  The conference I really want to go to (and actually have a chance of going to) is ICML (International Conference on Machine Learning) in Helsinki, Finland.  Eric said he'd rather to go to Spain, which sparked a very brief and unsuccessful search for conferences dealing with computational linguistics in Spain.

Today I came across a post on the comp.ai.nat-lang newsgroup pointing to a new wiki for <em>calls for papers</em>.  How timely!  And very nice.  A brief search on <a href="http://wikicfp.com/" title="WikiCFP - Wiki for calls for papers" target="_blank">WikiCFP</a> revealed that Eric's best chances are for the <a href="http://www.iula.upf.edu/agenda/euralex_08/" title="EURALEX 2008 Conference in Barcelona, Spain" target="_blank">EURALEX</a> <a href="http://www.iula.upf.edu/agenda/euralex_08/" title="Euralex 2008 conference in Barcelona, Spain" target="_blank"></a>conference in Barcelona, which deals with dictionaries (including software approaches).  Not that he's doing any work with dictionaries.   I may be, though, with my new project.  I'd much rather go to Helsinki, though, and ICML would do my career a lot of good.
