<p align="justify">It's a morning of fun new words!  First I hear <em>greenwashing</em> on the Today Show, which Donna likes to watch while she eats <a href="http://www.britsusa.com/about_guide.php" target="_blank">brekkie</a>.  Then, <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005360.html" target="_blank">Language Log</a> delights me with <em>nanoblahblah</em>, <em>henchgoon</em>, and <em>celebufreak</em>.  Erin McKean, the <a href="http://www.dictionaryevangelist.com/" target="_blank">Dictionary Evangelist</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/emckean" target="_blank">twitters words of the day</a> so I also got a nice infusion when I examined her twitter feed for the past week or so.  A few selections I particularly like that she found:  <em>paracosm</em>, <em>yostelumpet</em>, and <em>anthroponymy</em>.  And now for the definitions!</p>

<ul>
	<li>anthroponymy - <span class="entry-title entry-content">the study of the names of human beings [<a href="http://twitter.com/emckean/statuses/621988572" target="_blank">emckean@twitter</a>]</span></li>
	<li>celebufreak - a freak with fame (<a href="http://blogs.vibe.com/vc/2007/03/ray-j-and-kim-kardashian-sex-t/" target="_blank">e.g. Kim Kardashian</a>) [<a href="http://wordlust.blogspot.com/2007/01/celebufreak.html" target="_blank">Wordlustitude</a>]</li>
	<li>greenwashing - marketing a product as green when it's really not [<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22882532/" target="_blank">Today show</a>]</li>
	<li>henchgoon - alternate term for administrative assistant or "assistant of doom" [<a href="http://wordlust.blogspot.com/2005/03/henchgoon.html" target="_blank">Wordlustitude</a>]</li>
	<li>nanoblahblah - very, very tiny nonsense (nanotechnobabble) [<a href="http://wordlust.blogspot.com/2008/01/nanoblahblah.html" target="_blank">Wordlustitude</a>]</li>
	<li>paracosm - a private imaginary world, esp. made by children to escape harsh circumstances (think <em>Pan's Labyrinth</em>) [<a href="http://twitter.com/emckean/statuses/638055242" target="_blank">emckean@twitter</a>]</li>
	<li>yodelumpet - <span class="entry-title entry-content">a singing style that combines yodeling and Louis-Armstrong-style trumpet-like sounds [<a href="http://twitter.com/emckean/statuses/633685782" target="_blank">emckean@twitter</a>]</span></li>
</ul>
Please note that the twitter links are stable in terms of link permanence, but are unstable in twitter's ability to serve up the page.  So if at first you get a bizarre message with birds, try again.   This has also led to the re-discovery of the most excellent <a href="http://wordlust.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Wordlustitude</a> site.  I had seen a while ago but for whatever reason didn't subscribe to it.  This has been remedied, and if you like neologisms, I recommend you do the same.
