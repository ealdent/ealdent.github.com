October 6th was World Ecological Debt Day -- the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/main.jhtml?xml=/earth/2007/10/06/eadebt106.xml" title="World Ecological Debt day" target="_blank">date on which</a> the world officially begins living beyond its means.  Renewable resources are used up and we begin eating into natural resources.  According to <a href="http://www.neweconomics.org/gen/" title="new economics foundation" target="_blank">nef</a>, where I got the wonderful word <em>clonetown</em> (meaning the big shops in suburbia that you see everywhere -- and it all looks the same), World Ecological Debt Day comes earlier every year.  If the entire world lived as those in the UK do, we'd need three planets.

I also <a href="http://ealdent.stumbleupon.com/public/" title="my stumbleupon profile" target="_blank">stumbled on</a> an <a href="http://www.ecofoot.org" title="What's your ecological footprint?" target="_blank">ecological footprint quiz</a>.  Answer a few questions and it estimates your ecological impact.  If everyone lived like me, we'd need 3.2 planets.  That's almost half of what the average person in the US requires, though, so that's good.  I think I win big in the transportation department, since I use public transportation and carpool almost exclusively.  Plus I don't usually travel very far.  School is only just over a mile away.

Take the quiz and let me know what you scored in the comments.
