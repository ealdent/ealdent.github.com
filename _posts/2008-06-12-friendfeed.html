<p>After hearing about it for weeks, I caved and decided to check out <a href="http://friendfeed.com" target="_blank">friendfeed</a> last night [and again, ht <a href="http://dpn.name/index.php/2008/06/12/does-using-friendfeed-encourage-people-not-to-read-your-posts/" target="_blank">@dpn</a>].  In previous posts I mentioned something I like to call the <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/12/09/information-diaspora/" target="_self">information diaspora</a>.  This is the phenomenon created by posting all sorts of personal information about your likes, dislikes, thoughts, opinions, etc all over the web and your subsequent loss of that information because it can't be managed.  I can see friendfeed coming in handy for removing some of this problem.  You can attach a number of different social networking sites, flickr, youtube, etc all to your friendfeed account.  Whenever you post something new in one of these sites, that information will be updated on friendfeed for all of your friends (and yourself) to be able to view.  It's not the perfect solution, but it is a very big step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Check it out.  As usual, my username there is ealdent and feel free to friend me.</p>
