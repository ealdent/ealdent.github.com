I mentioned TGs in <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/08/21/leinenkugels-sunset-wheat/" title="Leinenkugels Sunset Wheat" target="_blank">a previous post</a>.  To refresh your  memory, they are the school of computer science's big departmental parties (actually thrown by the student organization, Dec/5).  The name has been generalized to any party thrown in the department.  Today's was the Smiley TG, celebrating <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/09/18/x-25/" title="-) x 25" target="_blank">the birthday of the smiley</a>, invented by Scott Fahlman, a professor in my department.  Planned as well as all things are, today is also the annual picnic for my department!  So I went to the TG, where I was almost completely without friends.  So I drank a Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA and left.  But not before grabbing some swag and snapping a pic of the pandemonium.
