<blockquote><strong><span class="me">social operating system </span></strong><span class="me">- <em>n.</em> </span> A social networking site like Facebook or MySpace that seamlessly integrates activities, including entertainment and shopping, to become a platform for online living.  (<a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/culturereviews/magazine/15-08/st_jw" title="Wired News - Jargon Watch" target="_blank">Wired News</a>)</blockquote>
I'm always on the lookout for new words.  This one isn't especially innovative, but the last phrase caught my notice.  <em>Online living</em>.  Indeed.  Now I like Facebook and actively maintain a profile as a way of keeping in touch with family and friends.  But <em>online living</em>?  I think that day is still a long ways off.
