<hr /><br />Original post can be found at:  <a href="http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2008/02/27/is-systran-going-statistical/" target="_blank">http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2008/02/27/is-systran-going-statistical/</a><br /><br />
<p align="justify">Systran is one of the oldest companies around that provide machine translation software.  They power some language-pairs of Microsoft's translation service, Altavista's Babelfish, and quite a few others (<a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/10/22/goodbye-systran/">including, until recently, Google</a>).  In the past, their software has been rule-based, so translation is done with a bilingual dictionary and a set of rules of how to change text from one language into another.  Based on a recent bevy of jobs postings on <a href="http://linguistlist.org/" target="_blank">Linguist List</a>, it appears they are going statistical.  Maybe they have been for a while, I don't know, since I don't actually follow what they do, but this piqued my interest.</p>
If your interest is piqued too, the listings are for:
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://linguistlist.org/issues/19/19-656.html" target="_blank">Research Scientist in computational linguistics</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://linguistlist.org/issues/19/19-655.html" target="_blank">Program manager</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://linguistlist.org/issues/19/19-654.html" target="_blank">Software Engineer</a></li>
</ol>
And, of course, salary ranges are not provided.
