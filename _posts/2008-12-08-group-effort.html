<p>Hal Daume has a nice post that deals with <a href="http://nlpers.blogspot.com/2008/12/two-reviewer-comments-that-stuck-with.html" target="_blank">credit in academia</a> among other things.</p>

<blockquote>What I took away from this comment is essentially the realization that we are <span>all</span> working toward some vague future goal, which has to do with computationalizing language processing (or some other topic, for the non-NLP audience). Progress is good. If I've done work that has something interesting and novel to say about this goal, then it's not bad -- and is often <span>good</span> -- that this builds on and improves on your work.</blockquote>
<p>So one illusion people have about science is that it is advanced by giant leaps.  An Einstein comes along and revolutionizes science.  If you live your life with this ambition, you will almost certainly end in disappointment.  Most advancements are small hops forward and are often <a href="http://apperceptual.wordpress.com/2007/01/15/the-heroic-theory-of-scientific-development/" target="_blank">multiply discovered</a>.  Believing that you will somehow be the next Einstein will probably have the opposite effect in your life.</p>
<p>I am becoming more and more convinced that intelligence is a matter of hard work, dedication, and interest.  I've seen some pop science reporting that a growing body of research supports praising kids for their effort rather than telling them how special they are.  I can't find the link at the moment, but that rings true to me.  I was always told I was the smartest person in the world as a child, and I think that made me intellectually lazy.  It took some pretty serious life mistakes to learn that so-called intelligence is more about effort.</p>
