<p align="justify">D'Arcy Norman has <a href="http://www.darcynorman.net/2007/12/12/on-creative-commons-licensing/" target="_blank">a great post</a> on the Creative Commons license and why to choose only CC:By rather than some of the stricter licenses.  This blog has been using CC:By since I began it, so it was nice to see someone with similar sensibilities putting out a much clearer statement of why it's a good idea than I could.</p>
<p align="justify">People are free to reuse anything I write on this blog or the pictures I take, may God help them, so long as they attribute what they have done to me.Â   So far the only ones who have used my stuff are spam blogs that mysteriously republish just about everything I write, often attributing it to some other author's name but posting a link back to my site.  Very bizarre.</p>
