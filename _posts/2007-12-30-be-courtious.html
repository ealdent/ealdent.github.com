<p align="justify">I found this in a bathroom of a Taco Bell near Sutton, West Virginia.  Not only is it misspelt, but there is something wonky with the logic here.  Why should I be courteous and lock the door?  Isn't the social norm that people knock before entering a bathroom?  Granted, they would assume it's a multiperson bathroom in this case, but a sign could be put on the door:  "NOK FRSIT."  Also, doesn't it seem to assume that you won't mind much if someone barges in on you wiping yourself, but that the barging party<i> </i>will?  A better sign would remind you that you need to lock that door.</p>
