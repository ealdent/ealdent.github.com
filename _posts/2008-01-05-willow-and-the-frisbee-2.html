<p align="justify">While at my mom's house in Greenville, South Carolina, I played a little frisbee with Willow (my australian shepherd) in the back yard.  I took some video where I was throwing the frisbee, then switched over to my mom throwing it.  However, insanely, when my mom started throwing I put the cap on and failed to notice for like 10 minutes!!  Thereby losing all the good footage and left with only my crappy warmup footage.  I was so pissed at myself.  Bad noob cameraman!</p>
