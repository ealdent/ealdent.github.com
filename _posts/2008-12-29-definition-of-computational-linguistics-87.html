According to the somewhat suspect <a href="http://www.synonyms.net/definition/computational%20linguistics" target="_blank">Definitions.net</a> (suspect by default, since I haven't evaluated it otherwise):
<blockquote>1. (noun)  computational linguistics
the use of computers for linguistic research and applications</blockquote>
<p>This particular definition came to my attention thanks to a Google alert and I thought it was about the shortest definition of computational linguistics I've ever seen.  It might not be a half bad definition for telling friends and family what you do when you don't want to see them go all glassy-eyed and start drooling on themselves.  It's certainly not a <em>satisfying</em> definition, though.</p>
