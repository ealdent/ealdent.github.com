<p align="justify">I can stare at the moon on a clear night for quite a while.  When I was very young, I felt like I could reach out and touch it.  When I first got into model rockets (around 8 years old), I thought I could build one big enough one day to send it to the moon.  My stepfather at the time (Greg) dispelled that notion, but not unkindly.  Anyhow, I was looking at the moon tonight and thought it looked cool through the clouds.  I took this picture with the flash on, so the shutter speed was fast.  I tried taking several other shots with very slow shutter speeds, but the clouds blurred and the moon was overexposed.  I used a tripod, but unfortunately when I snap the shot I cause a slight jitter.  You can see there is a double-image effect going on here, which is the result of my movement after clicking the button.</p>
