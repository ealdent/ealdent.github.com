<p align="justify">Fred Thompson has <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/01/22/thompson-drops-out-of-gop-presidential-race/" target="_blank">dropped out</a> of the race for president.  I liked him on <i>Law and Order</i>, not so much as a presidential candidate.  Now he can go back to doing something he's relatively good at.  I'd feel more secure if Ghouliani dropped out (<a href="http://wrathfuldove.org" target="_blank">kudos</a> for the name).  His continued presence gives me shivers.  He's probably waiting for McCain to screw up and drive the electorate into his arms.</p>
