<p>The blagoblag is abuzz with word of <a href="http://cuil.com" target="_blank">cuil</a>, a search engine launched by some former Google engineers.  After many hours of downtime, I was able to check it out a short while ago.  The unfortunate result:  it blows.  It's so bad that it's as bad as your brain can comprehend.  Supposedly there are three times as many sites indexed as Google.  Well, that's because they have not filtered any of the spam sites out.  A search for "mendicant bug" yields multiple spam copies of my blog and some wordpress category pages on the first ten pages.  My blog is conspicuously missing.  A search for my name also yields pathetic garbage.  Multiple other searches all led to the same thing:  spam pages get the highest rankings.</p>
<p>If your goal is searching for spam, then try out cuil.  You might get lucky and get infected by some nasty spyware.  Otherwise, don't waste your time.</p>
