<p align="justify">My friend Israel is trying to raise money for laptops for school kids in Tanzania.  If you're on Facebook and have about 30 seconds, why not <a href="http://tinyurl.com/2b4udl" target="_blank">vote for him</a>?  Razoo is a speed granting organization that gives money to small charitable projects.  You can view his oh-so-pitiful video below.  I've suggested he update it by putting on heavy eye makeup and getting under a sheet and lamenting the fact that only a few thousand Tanzanian kids graduate high school every year.  They really could use your help, though and this requires you to spend no money!</p>
