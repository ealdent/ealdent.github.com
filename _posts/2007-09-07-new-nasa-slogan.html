NASA is looking for a new slogan and Wired wants one of its readers to be the one who comes up with it.  <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/09/write-and-vote-.html#more" title="Vote for NASA's new slogan on Wired" target="_blank">Vote for mine</a> or come up with your own.  My proposed slogan is "Earth is not room enough."
