<p align="justify">A recent journey through the Steel City.  And yes I am a menace to public safety.  This is downtown, which people from the 'Burgh pronounce <span title="Pronunciation in IPA" class="IPA">[dɑ:ntɑ:n] instead of the Standard American English </span><span class="pronset"><span class="show_ipapr"><span class="pron">[daʊn'taʊn].  If you're not familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" title="IPA" target="_blank">IPA</a>, it's more like <em>donton</em>.  But not quite.  It's amusing.  </span></span></span></p>

<p align="justify">Pittsburgh English is also sometimes called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh_English" title="Pittsburgh English" target="_blank">Pittsburghese</a>, a term that I'm not especially fond of.  But there is definitely a difference here.  Two of the biggest things that people will notice are the use of a the word <em>redd</em> <em>up</em>, meaning to straighten up.  That word is actually of Scots-Irish descent.  My original suspicion was from the German <em>aufraeumen</em>, but that's wrong.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Dutch_English" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Dutch</a> has a strong influence in other parts of Pennsylvania, so it was the obvious starting point.  Also, the verb <em>need</em> is used as the passive auxiliary so whereas in Standard American English (and most other dialects of English), you might say</p>

<p align="left">The room needs to be vacuumed.
or
The room needs vacuuming.
</p><p align="left">Pittsburghers will say</p>
<p align="left">The room needs vacuumed.</p>
<p align="justify">Most speakers reject this as ungrammatical.  Interestingly, this Pittsburgh dialect also crops up all over Pennsylvania, but not so much in Philadelphia.  My wife, who is from the York area (sort of East-South-Central PA), says these things also.  They all sound perfectly grammatical to me now as I've grown accustomed to hearing them, but I don't actually say them.  (Yet?)</p>
