<blockquote>You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.

Therefore, I propose a new, more correct name for the Internet:  the Intercat.  There will one day be a battle for the real name of the Information Superhighway, between the Einsteinians (advocating <em>the Intercat</em>), Stevensians (advocating <em>the Intertubes</em>), and a coalition of smaller factions known collectively as the Blagonites (advocating <em>Blogosphere</em>, <em>the Interblag</em>, and <em>the Blagoblag</em>).  Who will win is anyone's guess (but my money is on the Blagoblag).
