<p align="justify">A couple months ago, I wrote about <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/09/24/richard-hogg-dies/">Richard Hogg dying</a>.  He was a professor at the University of Manchester who edited the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCambridge-History-English-Language-Vol%2Fdp%2F052126474X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1195513439%26sr%3D8-3&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Cambridge History of the English Language</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=ur2&o=1" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> and did a lot of work on Old English morphology.  I had corresponded with him briefly a few months before he died about a lab project on computational morphology.  I was making a morphological analyzer for Old English verbs.  I'm actually still working on it and generalizing it to the rest of the language.  Anyhow, as I said before, he was a nice and helpful guy and it was a shame to see him go.</p>
<p align="justify">Now, the <a href="http://www.englang.ed.ac.uk/isle.html" target="_blank">International Society for the Linguistics of English</a> (ISLE) has set up a <a href="http://www.englang.ed.ac.uk/isle/richard-hogg-prize.html" target="_blank">scholarship</a> in his honor.   Early career scholars who are members of ISLE (membership can be applied for at the time of submission) are eligible.  Early career means you either haven't gotten your PhD yet or got it within the past two years.  Masters and undergraduate applicants are acceptable, but the expected entrant is a PhD candidate/recent recipient.  The paper may be on any research-related topic in English or English linguistics and will be judged on originality and the contribution of its results.  The prize is Â£500 and the submission deadline is March 31, 2008.</p>
