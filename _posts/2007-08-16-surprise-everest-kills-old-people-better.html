Mt. Everest, that bastian of adventure that draws thrill-seekers and wall street brokers with nothing else left to accomplish alike, is three times more likely to kill people over 60.  No kidding.  Actually this shouldn't be as obvious as it seems to be, since apparently old people adjust to higher altitudes more quickly and have more experience.  So why do they die?  Who freakin knows.  Thanks to Wired's <a href="http://news.wired.com/dynamic/stories/E/EVEREST_OLDER_CLIMBERS?SITE=WIRE&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT" title="Mt Everest kills old people better" target="_blank">less-than-completely-informative-article</a>, I'm in the dark.  They hint at the proliferation of older people in these expeditions, but really shouldn't that have been adjusted for in the statistics?

However, there is an up side.  Fun facts:
<ul>
	<li>1.5% of climbers under 60 die attempting Everest</li>
	<li>5% of climbers over 60 die</li>
	<li>31% of climbers under 60 make it to the top</li>
	<li>13% of climbers over 60 make it to the top</li>
</ul>
Just something to consider if you're old and seeking to conquer the world's tallest mountain.
