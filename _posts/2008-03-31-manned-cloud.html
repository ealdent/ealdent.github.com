<p align="justify">Another <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2008/01/10/manned-cloud-by-jean-marie-massaud/" target="_blank">cool airship</a> just caught my attention, this one a concept vehicle in the form of a hotel in the sky.  It looks a bit like how I imagined the flying manta cloud creatures from the <i>Black Company</i> books by Glen Cook.</p>
