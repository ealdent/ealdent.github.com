Last week <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/09/27/shoot-first-ask-questions-later/" title="Shoot first - ask questions later">I commented</a> on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/27/world/middleeast/27contractor.html?_r=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin" title="Blackwater USA in more shootings" target="_blank">the piece</a> in the NY Times about Blackwater USA being disproportionately involved in confrontations in Iraq.  A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/washington/02blackwater.html?_r=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin" title="Blackwater USA involved in nearly 200 shootings in iraq" target="_blank">followup piece</a> today indicates that they have been involved in 168 shootings in Iraq since 2005, and in "a vast majority of cases firing their weapons from moving vehicles without stopping to count the dead or assist the wounded."  The report was issued by the Democratic majority staff of a House committee and criticizes the State Department, as well, for helping cover up and gloss over several incidents.

This seems to confirm the suspicion that Blackwater USA has a culture of <em>shoot-first-ask-questions-later</em>.  And as I said before, the strain is just too much for people to handle.  Families in Iraq are torn apart when innocent people are killed and these security guys doing the shooting will be suffering the consequences for the rest of their lives as well.

Vote Kucinich.
