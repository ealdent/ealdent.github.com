<p>Looking back over 2008, there have been a lot of changes in my life.  Many of those are reflected in my blog, but few are reflected in the posts that have gotten the most traffic.  But for the hell of it, here are the top posts anyway.</p>

<p>Of all of those posts, the best one is hands down <a href="http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2008/11/30/10-reasons-to-use-git-for-research/">10 Reasons to Use Git for Research</a>.  After that, the <a href="http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2007/10/25/the-noobs-guide-to-parsing/">Noob's Guide to Parsing</a>.  Some of the posts with the most hits are just link-sharing, where I saw something cool (Salad Fingers, Steampunk Star Wars, Ambigrams) and then other people found my link first.  One definite change on this blog was a decrease in the frequency of my posts.  Around the end of last year, I was posting close to 2 items per day.  Now it has stretched out to about 2 items per week.  Maybe I'll reflect more on that later.</p>
<p>I'll leave you with these thoughts.</p>
