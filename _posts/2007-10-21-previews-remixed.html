Saw <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/i-love-this-fil.html" target="_blank">this</a> on the blog of <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/" target="_blank">Marc Andreessen</a>, co-founder of Netscape.  Maybe NSFW, certainly the language is very intense, so if you're offended by the granddaddy f-word, it makes an appearance about 47 times (rough guess, I'm not gonna bother to count).  In any case, it's a great example of what good editing can do.  The best example of this I've seen is a classic that everyone has probably seen:  Shining.
