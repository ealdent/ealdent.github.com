So <a href="http://www.twitter.com" title="Twitter - it blows" target="_blank">Twitter </a>still has not fixed <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/09/06/twitter-away/" title="Twitter away">the problem</a> with importing gmail contacts.  They responded to my email once, asking which browser I was using and if the problem happened for other browsers.  I replied that it was cross platform and on IE and firefox, but that was the last I've heard from them.  That was three weeks ago.  Blerg.
