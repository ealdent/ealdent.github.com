<p align="justify">I took the dogs to Frick Park this morning, something I hope to repeat as often as possible during the winter break.  By the time we get home from work/school, it's almost completely dark outside and we're still a few weeks from the winter solstice.  So the poor little devils don't get to go to their favorite park during the week otherwise.  I hear you asking, "How do you know it's their favorite, crazy?"  Well, they don't whimper when they get close to other parks.</p>

<p align="justify">And yeah there's no good reason here for it to be all old-timey except that I was bored. We didn't actually go to the dog park area since there was a big puddle in there (and no dogs), so we stayed out in the public area.  It's technically illegal to have dogs off leash there, but it's not enforced at this park.  Dog people have taken it over.  During the day, it's extremely empty too, so that's good.  We were on our way out and I thought I was hot stuff because I had avoided letting Willow get wet and muddy.  However, she managed to find a random puddle on a level area on a hillside.  It's freezing outside and the puddle is completely covered in ice.  That didn't stop her from cracking the ice, laying down in it and drinking to her heart's content.  Blerg.</p>
