<p align="justify"><img src="http://ealdent.files.wordpress.com/2007/11/slumberpartychristmas.jpg" alt="Slumber Party Christmas Album 2004" align="right" />So I've mentioned <a href="http://www.slumberpartydetroit.com/" target="_blank">Slumber Party</a> <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/11/07/the-problem-with-pandora/">before</a>.  They are a detroit girl band (femme doom rock) and are freakin awesome.  Seriously, I can't get enough.  They are just brilliant to me.  So anyhow, I saw they had a Christmas album with 2 unnamed songs.  According to the website, it's a limited edition of 50 hand made single CDs.  Sure enough, the CD arrived wrapped up like a Christmas present and the CD looks hand-painted, but I can't be sure.  Maybe that's just wishful thinking.</p>
<p align="justify">The first song on the CD was decent, but not really special in the way I look for from Slumber Party.  The second song made the whole CD worth it.  A quirky combination of spoken lyrics, a childrens choir, 50's harmonies, and haunting female vocals -- it's my new favorite Christmas song.</p>
