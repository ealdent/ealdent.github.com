Language Log <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/001133.html" title="Language Log" target="_blank">brought up</a> the usage of the phrase <em>another thing coming</em> today.  This is the only way I've ever heard it or seen it used.  But it turns out, the original is <em>another think coming</em>.  The <em>thing</em> version is winning out on the interwebs, but the post on Language Log indicates that the two phrases may have been warring since their (mutual?) inceptions.  It's no surprise to me that <em>thing</em> would replace <em>think</em> in this case, for simple phonological reasons.  The [k] in <em>think</em> is preceded by a voiced nasal sound (the vocal cords are vibrating) and then followed by a unvoiced velar stop (aka plosive, but essentially another [k] sound).  The phenomenon of assimilation occurs when a phoneme changes to reflect the surrounding phoneme(s).  In this case, the [k] probably originally became voiced, which would make it a [g] sound.  The [k] and [g] sounds are essentially the same, it's just a difference in whether your vocal cords are vibrating.  So, assimilation generated <em>thing </em>instead of <em>think </em>in regular speech and since that is a well known word, people interpreted it as <em>thing</em> instead of <em>think </em>when they were first exposed to it.  From there it has been gaining steam.

Another interesting example of a similar nature is <em>home in on</em> versus the original <em>hone in on</em>.
