The Computer and Communications Industry Assocation is a nonprofit organization with members including Google, Microsoft, RedHat, Sun, and the Linux Foundation.  To boil it down: they're a lobbying group for the computing industry.  I'm not saying they are therefore bad:  it's the unfortunate state of Washington that everything and everyone has to have a lobbyist in order to get anything done.  For the moment I consider this group to be one of the "ok" guys (I'm not sure I'll call them the "good" guys yet).

So yesterday, they released <a href="http://www.ccianet.org/artmanager/publish/news/First-Ever_Economic_Study_Calculates_Dollar_Value_of.shtml" title="CCIA Study on Fair Use" target="_blank">a study</a> that reports that fair use exceptions in US copyright law account for $4.5 trillion in revenue each year:  18% of US economic growth.  I'm not sure what economic growth is referring to here exactly.  It's not GDP because GDP is $13.13 trillion per year, which would make that percentage about 34%.  This $4.5 trillion compares to the $1.3 trillion estimated to be the value that copyright industries contribute [<a href="http://informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201805939" title="Information Week" target="_blank">source</a>].  The fair use exception value is growing at a fast rate too, 31% since 2002.

So if fair use is that much better for business, why not expand it?  Would it only eat into that $1.3 trillion or would it expand the economy even further?
