<p align="justify">The shuttle Discovery is set to launch Tuesday to bring the Harmony module to the International Space Station (ISS).  The Harmony module, named by US school kids, is a connector that will bring together the various international components of the space station.  Specifically, it will connect the US Destiny Lab, the ESA's (European Space Agency) Columbus module and Japan's Kibo module.  The Italian-built Harmony module has been sitting in drydock since 2003, where it underwent pre-flight preparation.</p>
