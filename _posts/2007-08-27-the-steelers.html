<p>Well, I'm not really into sports of any kind, but I don't mind seeing games live.  On July 4th, I got to see the Pittsburgh Pirates play the Milwaukee Brewers.  And then a couple weeks ago, Donna (my wife) was offered tickets for a Steelers game from a friend at work, so we jumped on them.  These tickets are very difficult to come by.  Donna had no real interest in going, so I invited my friend <a title="Eric Davis" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dhdavis/" target="_blank">Eric</a>.  The seats were expensive and in the nose-bleed section, but that didn't really matter.  The biggest problem was the fact that this game was pre-season.  That didn't really mean anything to me until it was explained that usually the starting players only make brief appearances and the rest of the game consists of the crappier players.  Sure enough, once it was pretty much decided that Pittsburgh was going to win, the lower-ranked players jumped in and the sloppiness increased by an order of magnitude.  No one was playing an especially great game.  Pittsburgh made a lot of mistakes and really should've beaten the Eagles by another 14 points.</p>
<p>But it was great fun.  If I get a chance to do it again, I'll invite my dad, since he's been a Steelers fan for as long as I've been alive.</p>
