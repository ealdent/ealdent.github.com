<p>Figured I'd post this promo video the GWAP group did.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to participate in the filming of it since I was visiting my dad and family in Ohio for the first time after many years.  So unfortunate in that I missed the filming, but the alternative was worth it.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jcl5m" target="_blank">Johnny Lee</a> had a not insignificant role in the making of the video, I believe.  Check out his stuff if you haven't, he's doing some pretty amazing things with Wii remotes.</p>
