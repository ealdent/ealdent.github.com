<p><a href="http://twitrratr.com/" target="_blank">Twitrratr</a> is a new service that attempts to do sentiment analysis on <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/ealdent" target="_blank">follow me</a> while you're at it).  According to their about page, they started off by tracking opinions on Obama but have since expanded to any term.  Enter a keyword and it searches twitter for occurrences.  It then assigns a sentiment to each post and returns percentages of positive, neutral, and negative tweets for that word.  You can also track your own sentiment by searching for <a href="http://twitrratr.com/search/@ealdent" target="_blank">@your-username</a>.  I come up neutral, but there's not a lot of data to go on there.</p>
<p>Their method appears to be fairly simple.  They have a collection of adjectives with sentiment values (negative, positive) and based on what appears in a given tweet, they can classify a sentence.  Of course, this is probably low recall (meaning it misses a lot of tweets that do express sentiment) since sentiment can be expressed without using adjectives.  I'm not sure if it tries to do anything with negation, but so far my scans of results look like it ignores it.</p>
<p>So even though it's pretty ghetto, it's a nice toy.  If they care to extend the algorithm, they have some pretty cool data to work with.  I think it would be cool to get some (possibly donated, probably not paid) human effort together to tag some of their data to release as a research dataset.</p>
