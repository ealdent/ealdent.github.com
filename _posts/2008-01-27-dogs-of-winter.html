<p align="justify">It has been snowing here all day, so I'm in a wintry mood.  I've taken a few pictures over the past couple weeks with my new camera.  I particularly like this picture of Willow in the mirror with a snowy tree visible in the window.</p>

<p align="justify">  A couple weeks ago at Frick Park, one of the trails iced over completely.  Walking on it was pretty hazardous and I was slipping a lot, but there were joggers running by who didn't seem to have a problem.  Maybe I have bad snow shoes.  Daedal didn't seem to have a problem with it, either.</p>

<p align="justify">Willow loved the ice road more than Daedalus.  You can probably see that she is a filthy mess in this picture.  There was an area where the ground wasn't frozen and it was insanely muddy.  If she likes anything better than a hole in ice where she can lie in the water, it's a hole in ice where she can lie in mud.</p>

<p align="justify">And here is Willow at Schenley Park last Wednesday.  She looks kinda wolf-like to me.  Like she is about to chase down a ball and hamstring it.</p>
