George Takei, better known as Sulu to the world of non-hardcore Trek fans, <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/10/03/asteroid_spa.html?category=space&guid=20071003093030&dcitc=w19-502-ak-0000" title="Sulu gets an asteroid" target="_blank">now has an asteroid</a> named after him.  I say non-hardcore Trek fans because hardcore Trek fans know his real name.  Or maybe it's semi-hardcore.  Super hardcore probably have lost all touch with reality and believe he really <em>is</em> Sulu.  In any case, asteroid 7307 is now 7307 Takei, joining the mighty ranks of 4659 Roddenberry and 68410 Nichols (Lt. Uhura's real name).  In an unfortunate bit of news, the asteroid was knocked off a <strike>balcony</strike> roof in New York and fell to its death.
