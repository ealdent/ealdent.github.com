<p>I think that <em>Memories of the Sun</em> would be a fitting name for a Pittsburgh blog.  When I was younger, I loved dark, cloudy weather.  I've never been a fan of the steel gray overcast that doesn't change, but it didn't bother me much.  After experiencing it nearly nonstop for the past few months, it gets to you a bit.  I didn't fully realize that until I was standing outside today, in the park, with the sun out, and the sky deep blue beside swiftly moving cumulus clouds.  I <em>missed</em> the sun.</p>
<p>My favorite Pittsburgh weather comes at the beginning of autumn, when the temperature begins to drop and the leaves are changing.  It doesn't seem to rain quite as much then and it can be quite beautiful.</p>
<p>I'll be travelling south this week, to Oak Island, NC for my sister's wedding.  The North Kakalakee beach in early summer (which begins in April in the South) should be nice and refreshing.  And just as summer begins there early, spring gets started late here.  It has been less than 60 degrees out for most of the past week.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, probably no blogging for the next week.</p>
