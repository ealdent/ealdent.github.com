While wandering the interwebs, I came across <a href="http://www.unsicht-bar-berlin.de/" title="unsicht-bar: deutschlands erste dunkelrestaurant: unsighted bar: germany's first dark restaurant" target="_blank">Unsicht-Bar</a>:  Germany's first dark restaurant.  The idea is simple, the execution not so much.  The entire dining experience is done in pitch black.  You can't even see your hand in front of your face.  The wait staff are all blind or visually impaired so they get along just fine.  You, however, probably won't.  It's an interesting idea and certainly a good way of helping you to "visualize" what it means to be blind, so to speak.

<p align="center">Unsicht = without sight
Bar = um, a bar

The meals are laid out so that you know where things are based on the <em>hands of the clock</em>.  The website says that the minimum duration of a meal is about two hours, anything less and you don't get the full experience.  They don't expect you to go to the restroom in the dark, though, so that's good.  And there's coupons!</p>
