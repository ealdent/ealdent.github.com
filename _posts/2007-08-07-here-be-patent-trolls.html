It appears that <a href="http://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook" target="_blank">Facebook </a>has just had another lawsuit filed against it, this time for patent infringement.  <strong>Cross Atlantic Capital Partners</strong> (hereafter referred to as <em>the Patent Trolls</em>) claim infringement based on <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN%2F6519629" title="USPTO Patent 6,519,629" target="_blank">patent 6,519,629</a>:  "System for creating a community for users with common interests to interact in".  So it appears they are targeting the <em>Groups</em> functionality.  I don't pretend to know anything about patent law, but from what I have read in the patent, it does appear they have a case.  However, I believe this is just one more example of how issuing patents for software is fundamentally flawed.

The Patent Trolls sat on this patent for years, doing nothing with it.  Facebook came around, had a good idea (whose idea it was exactly is the subject of another lawsuit) and made it real.  If we must have patents for software, then I propose that they be limited to 2 years for concepts.  By the time a patent is issued, the inventor has already had a few years to implement the system.  In this case, the patent was applied for in 2000 and granted in 2003.  I think a five year headstart on the competition is more than sufficient.  Considering what they've done with it in that time...

I'll leave you with a quote from "<a href="http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/industry-at-risk.html" title="an Industry at Risk" target="_blank">Software Patents: An Industry at Risk</a>" by the League for Programming Freedom:
<blockquote>Borland didn't invent compilers.  Microsoft didn't invent operating systems.  Novell didn't invent networking.  Sun didn't invent Unix. Apple didn't invent the graphical user interface.  Oracle didn't invent the database.  It turns out that nearly all successful software companies have concentrated on constructing better implementations of already existing technologies.  The market rewarded these companies because they provided the market with what it wanted: products, not ideas.  These companies didn't have a horde of researchers working in obscure fields in the hope that one of them would discover something useful.  In the software industry ideas are like air.  The hard part is deciding which ideas to choose.  The focus of these companies was on "doing it right" rather than on "doing it first" or "doing it differently".  By allowing other companies to monopolize new technologies, patents strike at the very essence of the software industry's business philosophy.</blockquote>
