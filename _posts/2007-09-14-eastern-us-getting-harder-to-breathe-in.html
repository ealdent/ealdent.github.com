The National Resources Defense Council is reporting on <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/media/2007/070913.asp" title="National Resources Defense Council study on decrease in air quality because of global warming" target="_blank">a study</a> that looked at ten eastern US cities are found they are going to see more <em>red alert</em> days during the summer for air quality.  They found that rising temperatures due to global warming will lead to a decrease in the number of <em>good air</em> days (as defined by the EPA).  Two of the cities I have lived in were included in the study:  Columbus, Ohio and Greenville, South Carolina.  Another city included was Asheville, NC where Donna and I have spent several anniversaries.  Greenville and Asheville are both very beautiful cities, so it's really a shame to see that things will be going downhill.  The same will be true everywhere, of course.  By the middle of the century, the study reports, 50 eastern US cities will see:
<ul>
	<li>A doubling of the number of unhealthy ‘red alert’ days</li>
	<li>A 68 percent (5.5 day) increase in the average number of days exceeding the current 8-hour ozone standard established by the EPA</li>
	<li>A 15 percent drop in the number of summer days with “good” air quality based on EPA criteria because of global warming</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Asheville, NC</li>
	<li>Cleveland, OH</li>
	<li>Columbus, OH</li>
