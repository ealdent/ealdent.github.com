<p>While at Oak Island, we visited the North Carolina Aquarium.  It was decent, nothing on the Baltimore Aquarium, but it had some cool stuff.  In the southeastern swampland exhibit, there was a very specific sign (below) about what not to do on the plants.  When I <em>trundled</em> on the venus flytrap three feet away, I had the perfect excuse, but they didn't buy it...</p>

<p>There was also an outdoor pond with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_noun" target="_blank">bale of baby turtles</a> and some carp.</p>
