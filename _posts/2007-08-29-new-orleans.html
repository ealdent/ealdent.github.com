<hr /><br />Original post can be found at:  <a href="http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2007/08/29/new-orleans/" target="_blank">http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2007/08/29/new-orleans/</a><br /><br />
I am going to say this even though it is not politically correct.  Abandon New Orleans.  Help the people there move out and establish new digs.  It has long been known that New Orleans is sinking.  As sediment is poured into the ocean from the Mississippi River, the Earth's crust (1) bends under the weight.  Currently this is resulting in the city sinking at the rate of 1-8 mm per year.  So when the next Katrina comes, and everyone agrees that it will, all of this effort and money will have been for naught.  Plus more people and pets will probably die.

So why are we down there rebuilding on rotten ground?  It seems like there is almost some religious zeal driving people to reestablish this Mecca of jazz, Mardi Gras and debauchery.  Is that too harsh or prudish?  Seriously, is it just so that we can have a great party town?  The arguments I have seen tout the Army Corps of Engineers new plan to protect the city against future disasters.  Geologists say this is futile.  There is nothing we can do when the whole crust is bending beneath the weight of the sediment dumped by the fourth longest river in the world.

Now granted, there is a lot of historical importance to New Orleans.  Preserving that is not a complete waste of time.  It doesn't mean people should be building their homes there.  Let me just conclude with these thoughts from <a href="http://geology.com/articles/rebuilding-new-orleans.shtml" title="Geology.com - should we rebuild new orleans?" target="_blank">Geology.com</a>:
<ul>
	<li><font>Hurricanes will repeatedly impact New Orleans</font></li>
	<li><font>Sea level is rising and reduces the effectiveness of any levee system over time</font></li>
	<li><font>The city is subsiding and this also reduces levee effectiveness</font></li>
	<li><font>The current levee system is vulnerable to terrorist attack at many points</font></li>
</ul>

(1) Actually it is the entire lithosphere that is bending which includes the crust, the Moho, and the upper mantle.
