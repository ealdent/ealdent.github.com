I really don't know just what to make of this guy.  He recently gave <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/24/AR2007092401042_pf.html" title="President Ahmadinejad's speech at Columbia transcript" target="_blank">a speech</a> at Columbia University, as I'm sure everyone knows by now who follows such things (and for those that don't, he's the president of Iran).  On the one hand, he talks a good game about peace and the dangers of scientists blindly pursuing technologies that are blatantly harmful to human existence.  When this happens, he says, the scientists are being misused by oppressors.  Scientists who are under the thumb of these oppressors (or are themselves oppressors) are withholding knowledge, as well.  So far so good.  It's mildly paranoid, but seems like a reasonable opinion (perhaps because I am fairly paranoid myself?).

There was also a lot of stuff about the Koran's version of the Garden of Eden story and a ridiculous number of religious platitudes and declarations of gratefulness and fidelity to Allah.  This was all very boring and made it hard for me to want to keep going.  Persevere I did.

<!--more-->
He then proceeds through a lengthy and circumspect denunciation of the Bush regime.  Many of his points here were quite true.  Ahmadinejad definitely built himself up in this speech as the underdog who is trapped by a giant warmongering behemoth between Iraq and a hard place (I can hear you groaning from here).  Here's a snippet:
<blockquote>"They even violate individual and social freedoms in their own nations under that pretext. They do not respect the privacy of their own people. They tap telephone calls and try to control their people. They create an insecure psychological atmosphere in order to justify their warmongering acts in different parts of the world."</blockquote>
He also denounces the stockpiling of nuclear weapons by the US on humanitarian grounds, asking what benefit can humanity possibly have by being under the constant threat of nuclear war.  He also brings up the existence of Israel and the problems going on there, a theme too large and complicated for me to do more than just mention, at this point.

But then he starts to question the holocaust.  Rather, he questions why researchers who have been looking into alternative perspectives to the holocaust have been silenced or imprisoned.  One wonders exactly whom he is referring to, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving" title="David Irving - Wikipedia" target="_blank">David Irving</a> seems a good candidate, since he was tried and convicted in Austria of being a Nazi sympathizer in 2006.  They weren't able to charge him with holocaust denial since that crime occurred in 1989 and the law wasn't enacted until three years later.  So is Ahmadinejad actually saying the holocaust didn't happen?  Yes and no.  No, he isn't saying that explicitly, but he is calling for freedom to pursue research into this fundamental question of what occurred in Europe during the second world war.  But yes, he is denying it in effect by calling into question a historical  event so well documented and established as fact.

Also, he justifies the execution of homosexuals in Iran.  When posed the question, he switches to talking about executing drug dealers.  After all, we have capital punishment in America, so who are we to judge?  But oh, the question wasn't why does Iran execute drug traffickers, it's why does it execute homosexuals.  His answer?
<blockquote>"In Iran, we don't have homosexuals, like in your country." (Audience laughter.) "We don't have that in our country."  (Audience booing.)  "In Iran, we do not have this phenomenon. I don't know who's told you that we have it."</blockquote>
That is really bad.  When someone does something like this, it throws everything they say into question.  Is he just stupid?  Is he lying purposely?  I honestly don't think this is a stupid man.  As he says, he is an academic and there is plenty of evidence to back this up.  That doesn't mean he has any sense.  Also, I think it would be harder to become president in Iran if you're stupid than it is in the US.   So he must be lying.  Is it just rhetoric or is he trying to avoid a sticky subject -- one that will most definitely turn American audiences against him?

So what to make of him?
<ul>
	<li> I like what he says about peace and the misuses of science</li>
	<li>He annoys me with his constant platitudes about the glory of Allah</li>
	<li>A lot has been reported in the media about his human rights abuses</li>
	<li>how much of this can I believe and how much is propaganda?</li>
	<li>very similar propaganda was generated in the buildup to the Iraq war that was later shown to be false (e.g. weapons of mass destruction)</li>
	<li>I don't want to see him falsely villified and have that be a justification for a war against Iran</li>
	<li>He's a holocaust denier</li>
	<li> He's a homosexual denier (??) (and executioner)</li>
</ul>
I don't have enough facts to make a full decision about him.  I've read a few things about him in the past that gave me a more sympathetic feeling towards him.  Ahmadinejad advocated peace and explained how US posturing was putting his country in a very difficult position.  I absolutely do not think he has done anything that requires the US to invade his country and overthrow him.  The results of that would be absolutely catastrophic.  On the other hand, I think he is insincere about his desire for unfettered research.  I think he is also a liar.

The political climate in Iran is still affected by the meddling the US has done there over the past half century -- chiefly the CIA-backed coup in 1953.  If we really want to see democratic reform in Iran, it will have to be inspired by the people of Iran.  We need to step back and let them proceed naturally.  Democracy is a thing you earn.  If not, it's a ripe fruit waiting to become overcome by corruption.
