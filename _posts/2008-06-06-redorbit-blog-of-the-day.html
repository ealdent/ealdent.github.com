</p><p><a href="http://www.redorbit.com/" target="_blank">RedOrbit</a> named me one of their <a href="http://www.redorbit.com/technology/blogs_of_the_day/?site_id=3272" target="_blank">blogs of the day</a> today.  Go me!  I had come across them a time or two before.  They are a space/tech news site.  Not bad for that sort of thing and certainly less spammy and clunky than <a href="http://space.com" target="_blank">Space.com</a>.</p>
