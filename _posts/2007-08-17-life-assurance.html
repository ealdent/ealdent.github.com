I came across an interesting difference in usage between British and American versions of the word <em>assurance</em>.  The word typically means <em>a promise </em>or <em>a guarantee</em> in American English.  So when I came across this ad on the Scotsman it caught my eye.  Hell yes I want my life assured!  Turns out, to the Brits, it just means <em>insurance.</em>  Pity.
