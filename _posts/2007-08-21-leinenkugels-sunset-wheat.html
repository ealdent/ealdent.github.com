Tonight was the reception "TG" for new students of the <a href="http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu" title="Language Technologies Institute" target="_blank">Language Technologies Institute</a>.  TG is the general term given to parties thrown in the department of computer science at CMU.  Typically TGs are thrown on Fridays by the student organization Dec/5.  So TG as in TGIF.

So anyhow, I tried a new beer that I hadn't heard of before called Leinenkugels Sunset Wheat.  I was given a tip prior to coming to the TG that Leinenkugels was the mystery beer.  After a quick search on <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com" title="Ratebeer.com - Best site for craft beer information" target="_blank">ratebeer.com</a>, I found that Leinenkugel has one good beer and a whole lot of crap.  Smart money was on the crap being the pick.  Unfortunately, this was correct.  I even guessed the correct specimen of crap:  the Sunset Wheat.

So I decided to taste it so I could add another beer to my rating list.  My reaction was immediate.  Here is the comment I posted on the <a href="http://ratebeer.com/beer/leinenkugels-sunset-wheat/57459/41265/" title="Rateber.com:  Leinenkugels Sunset Wheat" target="_blank">ratebeer page for this beer</a>:
<blockquote><span class="beer">"I was immediately struck by a similarity to Flintstones vitamins. It was so intense I exclaimed. This beer was really atrocious. On the up side, it didn’t linger very long on the palate. This is a drain pour."</span></blockquote>
I stand by this assessment.  After I posted my comment I perused the other comments to see if people agreed with me.  What I found was great.  A few of the tastier specimens I came across are below:
<blockquote>"<span class="beer">There are aromas &amp; flavors in this that just don’t belong in a beer. Tastes like the milk left over after eating a bowl of Fruit Loops was poured into my beer. And worse, the fruit taste is very artificial. Maybe it wouldn’t be bad on a hot day, but I think i’m going to avoid this one for now.</span>

"<span class="beer">If I got really drunk on beer Friday, woke up on Saturday and ate some Fruity Pebbles then threw up...this is what it would taste like."</span>

<span class="beer">"On tap. Smell is 100% Fruity Pebbles Cereal. It is uncanny - as though it is liquid Fruity Pebbles. Cloudy golden appearance with no lastin head. Reminds me more of a Hefe than an American Wheat. Really distinctive orange flavor. Almost tastes like a candy beer. Very sweet taste."</span>

"<span class="beer">not so good.  Had a flavor of jelly beans totally nasty.  Might be the worst beer Ive tasted"</span></blockquote>
Scanning just a few more pages of comments I found 8 more references to Fruity Pebbles.  I think the key here is that distinct artificial fruit flavor they put in jelly beans, flintstones vitamins and that cereal.  So yeah, it sucked.
