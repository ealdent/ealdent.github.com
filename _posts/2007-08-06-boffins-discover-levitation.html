Well the Department of Mysteries at St. Andrews College has done it again.  Last September they described <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/25729" title="invisibility cloak possible" target="_blank">a way to make objects invisible</a>.  Now they have found <a href="http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/Title,14834,en.html" title="Casimir force reversed - levitation now possible" target="_blank">a way to make objects levitate</a>.  It doesn't seem like we'll be seeing levitating cars any time soon, but it does look like this may be the sort of revolutionary discovery that will take computing, robotics and manufacturing to the next level.
