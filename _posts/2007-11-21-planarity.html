<p align="justify">I love puzzle games that really challenge your mind.  <a href="http://www.planarity.net/" target="_blank">Planarity</a> is such a game.  You are presented with several vertices connected by edges.  The vertices are shuffled and many of the edges overlap.  The goal is to move the vertices so that the edges are no longer intersecting.  Simple enough, right?  As you progress in level, the challenge increases.  More and more vertices are added.  After beating level 7, I was too tired to continue, but that has nothing to do with the game.  Too much homework and insomnia.  Anyhow, the game is really awesome and I strongly recommend checking it out for anyone who wants to exercise their brain.</p>
