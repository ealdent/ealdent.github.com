Language Log has <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004928.html" title="Talk like a pirate" target="_blank">a nice salute</a> to Talk Like a Pirate Day, where I found this clip:

 I used to have a pretty good pirate accent, but lately it's been turning into an Irish leprechaun accent.  <em>Avast ye scurvy laddy, come look at me pot o' gold</em>.  I'll have to practice.  Oddly enough, my irish accent degenerates into a pseudo-pirate imitation.  My current best is ze Frenchman and my Scottish brogue.  Be sure to check out that Language Log post for the pirate ergonomic keyboard.
