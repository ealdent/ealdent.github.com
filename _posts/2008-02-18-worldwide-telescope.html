<p align="justify">Rumors are brewing that Microsoft is going to announce <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/02/18/microsoft-to-announce-worldwide-telescope-on-january-27/" target="_blank">the release of a new product</a> called Worldwide Telescope later this month.  WT should allow users to zoom in on parts of the sky for which data exists.  Data will be drawn from a number of ground-based telescopes as well as Hubble.  Google Sky does this already in a nauseatingly ugly way.  It's bad.  Epic fail there.  Stellarium, on the other hand, is an open source star charting program that blows Google Sky away.  I've been using it for a few years now and have been very happy with it.  From the sound of the TechCrunch article, though, Worldwide Telescope could blow Stellarium away.  I really hope so.  And if it's free, I'll be forced to give Microsoft props for doing something right for a change.</p>
