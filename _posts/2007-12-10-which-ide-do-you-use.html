<p align="justify">Up until recently, I was pretty old school with how I write my code.  <a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a>, baby.  No code completion only syntax highlighting.  I had used a couple IDEs back when I first started taking classes, but just found them cumbersome.  For my software engineering class this semester and for my project next semester, I will have to use Eclipse.  This gave me my first opportunity to use Subversion in a team environment as well.  I must say, I was seriously missing out.  Eclipse has been really fun to use and being able to check in code and keep track of changes has been invaluable.  Now I'm subversioning all of my side projects.  Overkill?  Well, this way I can instantly sync between my laptop and my school linux machine.  I use the school machine to run experiments since it's running four 3 GHz processors whereas my laptop has only two 1.8's.</p>
<p align="justify">Anyway, last night I decided to check out the new version of the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/" target="_blank">NetBeans IDE</a> (6.0).  I had used it very briefly in the past and found it to be a slow resource hog.  It's still a hog, but runs fine on my laptop with 2 GB of RAM.  Plus the new features are pretty awesome.  Not only does it have code completion, but code suggestions and instant generation of get/set methods for your class variables.  Also, like Eclipse, it has subversion support built-in.</p>
<p align="justify">Which IDE do you use?  I'm admitting here and now to being a noob to the IDE world, so is there something better?</p>
