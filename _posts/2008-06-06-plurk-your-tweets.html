<p>A couple of days ago, I wrote a script that would <a href="http://twitter.com/ealdent" target="_blank">tweet</a> anything you <a href="http://plurk.com/redeemByURL?from_uid=12298&check=-1874285239&s=1" target="_blank">plurked</a>.  Thanks to some code from <a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2008/06/plurk-python-post-script.html" target="_blank">Neville Newey</a> (based on PHP code by <a href="http://blog.charlvn.za.net/2008/06/plurk-python-post-script.html" target="_blank">Charl van Niekerk</a>), the <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jmadams/source/plurk.py" target="_blank">plurk.py</a> script I wrote has been updated to both plurk your tweets and tweet your plurks.  This should work on both windows and linux machines.  If you have access to a linux machine, I suggest setting up a cron job to take care of this.  As I mentioned in <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2008/06/02/tweet-your-plurks/" target="_self">the previous post</a>, if you set up a cron job, be sure to change the path to plurkdb.dat to an absolute path.  I have done the most testing on this with python 2.4 in linux.</p>

Neville's code appears to be under CC:Attribution 2.5 for South Africa, by what I could glean from his site.  I have considered making this an open source project under Google code but have yet to take it all the way.  Google sets a lifetime limit of 10 projects, so I will continue to hoard those against future need.  If you make modifications to the code, please let me know and I will probably post them here and in the code for future releases, so we all win.</p>
<p>Note that the command line parameters have changed:</p>
<p><code>plurk.py &lt;twitter username&gt; &lt;twitter password&gt; &lt;plurk username&gt; &lt;plurk password&gt;</code></p>
