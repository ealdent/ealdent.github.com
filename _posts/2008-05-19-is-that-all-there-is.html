<p>My taste in music is definitely in flux.  Five years ago I would have found this intolerable, but now I can't stop listening to it.  I blame <a href="http://www.pandora.com" target="_blank">Pandora</a>.  The musical journeys it takes you on can be transformational.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the video stops before the song is over, but YouTube offers several full length suggestions immediately after.  The videos themselves are all insane, so I didn't want to endorse any.  I just listen to the sound track in another tab and don't watch them.</p>
<p>This question was a central theme in the movie <em>The Nines</em>, which I recommend.  It also came up in <em>Revolver</em>, which I just watched tonight, though it wasn't asked explicitly.  Instead, the question is who is your worst enemy?  The movie's position is that it is not external, but internal.  I think I can say that without spoiling anything.  The trick is to avoid the lie that your perception is infallible.  Pulling that off is a different matter altogether, though it is a helpful trait for a good scientist.</p>
