<p><a href="http://www.sciam.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=dogs-bark--not-fair-study-shows-pup-2008-12-08" target="_blank">A recent finding</a> by a University of Vienna team shows that dogs have a sense of fairness when it comes to getting treats.  If you treat one dog in the presence of another and don't treat that dog, it knows you did it wrong.Â  Yep, no surprise there.</p>
<p>And is it just me or is the dog in that article really a werewolf?</p>
