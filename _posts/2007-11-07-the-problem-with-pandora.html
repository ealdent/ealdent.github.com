But then it automatically starts playing and it's a really cool song and so I have to wait for the song to finish (since there's no guarantee I'll hear it again anytime soon).  Then another good song comes on.  And another.  Soon enough, I forgot why I visited.  Yeah, it's a hard life.</p>

<p align="justify">Currently loving:  <a href="http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/slumber+party" target="_blank">Slumber Party</a>:  "Detroit femme doom rock with a late-night vibe."  I personally love the combination of 50's rock harmonies, electronica and beautiful female vocals.</p>
