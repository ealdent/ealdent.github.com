<p align="justify">I took the dogs to a different dog park than usual today.  Schenley Park is within walking distance of our apartment, and then it was relatively easy to find a stretch of grass far enough away from the road that I could feel safe letting Willow off leash to play ball.  Daedalus and her both explored the woods a little bit, Daedalus still on his leash.  I just can't trust him to come when called if he gets on a scent.  Their coloring was perfect for the partially snow-covered leaves.</p>
