The Perseids meteor shower peaks around August 11-12 every year.  This year I'm going to visit my dad and uncle (and their families) in rural Ohio.  There is absolutely no light from cities there so this should be a great viewing this year.  I've only been able to view the Perseids from a remote location once before, sometime in the early 90's, so I'm looking forward to it.  Also, there will be no moon, so viewing will be optimal.  Unfortunately, I'll be viewing them Saturday night and the peak is going to be Sunday night/Monday morning.  Right now the weather forecast is extremely favorable, calling for clear conditions.  I hope (and pray) that this time the meteorologists get it right.
