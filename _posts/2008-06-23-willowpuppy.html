<p>While browsing my various photo albums (all of them digital) for a proper head shot of myself, I was struck by my complete absence.  I make appearances so rarely, it's like I don't exist in the photo history of my life.  I'm always the cameraman.  Really, I have so few pictures of myself throughout my entire life, I am basically a ghost.  There was a period of time in the late 90's when I had long hair.  I don't have a single picture of that (<a href="http://wrathfuldove.org/2008/06/21/old-photos/" target="_blank">this post</a> reminded me of that time).  But I do have pictures of my babies.  I found this while hunting.</p>
