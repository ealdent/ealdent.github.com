<p>Boffins at the University of Reading have created <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/08/13/frankenrobot-brain.html" target="_blank">a robot controlled by a biological "brain"</a> consisting of rat neurons.  They began by taking a culture of neurons specially separated from the rest of the fetal brain tissue.  The neurons are placed across a platter of electrodes that simultaneously allow the brain to control parts of a robot and allow the robot to send signals back to the brain.  In this way, the brain begins to operate the robot, moving it around and receiving feedback (electrical jolts) that tell it when it's hit something.</p>
<p>According to Kevin Warwick, one of the researchers, "It's quite funny -- you get differences between the brains.  This one is a bit boisterous and active, while we know another is not going to do what we want it to."  Warwick later speculates that much of the difference between rat and human brains lies in the number of neurons and not the neurons themselves.  Picking on that particular statement, since I think it's a pretty bold claim, you have to wonder about animals like whales and elephants who have one to two times the number of neurons we do.  If he's right and it's the number of neurons that makes the difference, we are literally killing sentient beings.  Of course, to the people who are killing blue whales and elephants, that doesn't matter one bit.</p>
<p>This technology troubles me a bit.  On the one hand, it's really cool.  Biological computers!  On the other hand, the potential for harm here is just enormous.  On the other other hand, it may pave the way for humans to place their brains in vats and replace their meat sacks with machinery.  On the other other other hand it may mean advanced combat robots that make iron man look like a sissy.  Or maybe not.  The recent round of research that aims to make animals into cyborgs (and often for military purposes) strikes me as a harbinger of a world where the line between artificial and biological life is blurred beyond recognition.  If a cyborg constructed in such a way can feel...</p>
