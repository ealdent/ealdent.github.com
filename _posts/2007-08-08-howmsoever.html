Now here is an interesting word.  The <a href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004807.html" title="Language Log - Howmsoever" target="_blank">Language Log</a> has a few examples of its usage and a couple of theories as to how it came about.  The first is that the archaic word <em>howsomever</em>, which was an alternate form for however, changed through metathesis to <em>howmsoever</em>.  I'm more inclined to the theory that it is derived by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analogy#Linguistics" title="Analogy in linguistics">analogy</a> from <em>whomsoever</em>/<em>whosoever</em>.  I can imagine a scenario where someone wants to drag out <em>however </em>to make what is about to be said more significant (or some such scenario).  It seems like <em>howmsoever </em>would fill that need nicely.  But who knows..
