<p align="justify">This conference looks like it might be fun if you're a student working on some area of AI/machine learning and going to a university in the Northeastern US.   <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/conferences/nescai/" target="_blank">NESCAI</a> is the North East Student Colloquium on Artificial Intelligence and will be held at Cornell May 2-4, 2008.  The deadline for papers is March 7, 2008, so the date is fast approaching.  The full CFP is below the fold.</p>

<h2> CALL FOR PAPERS</h2>
<p align="justify">The third annual North-Eastern Student Colloquium on Artificial Intelligence (NESCAI) will be hosted at Cornell University (Ithaca, NY) on May 2-4. Students are encouraged to submit papers describing <u>new or previously submitted</u> research and ideas in all areas of AI (see partial list below). A student must be a primary author of all submitted research.  Due to generous sponsorship, a small $50 registration fee covers conference costs and two nights of accommodations</p>
<p align="justify">NESCAI is the premier student colloquium on AI, bringing together students from all areas of Artificial Intelligence research. The colloquium hosts students from the U.S. Northeast and Eastern Canada and aims to foster an exchange of ideas, discussions and networking. NESCAI is sponsored by the Intelligent Information Systems Institute, the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, Yahoo Inc. and the National Science Foundation.</p>

<p><b>Submission Details:</b></p>
<p align="justify">We welcome both full and short papers. All accepted papers will be presented at a poster session and selected full papers will be accepted for talks.</p>
<i>FULL PAPERS</i> (8 pages): Appendices may exceed the eight-page limit, but the reviewers are under no obligation to read any material beyond the page limit. Full papers may be:
<ul>
	<li>Research papers presenting previously submitted or novel research in AI</li>
	<li>Conceptual papers presenting and motivating new ideas and research directions in AI</li>
	<li>Survey papers summarizing the state of the art in a particular sub-field of AI</li>
</ul>
<i>SHORT PAPERS</i> (2 pages): Short papers may be:
<ul>
	<li>Research abstracts</li>
	<li>Progress reports on ongoing research</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">All submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least two graduate students in the respective areas. We encourage the resubmission of both previously and currently submitted papers, as long as this is indicated by the author. We will work with authors to ensure that copyrights held by other conferences will not be violated but we do not anticipate any problems, as there will be no formal publication of NESCAI proceedings.</p>
