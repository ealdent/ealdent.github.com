WonkoKevin over on <a href="http://wonkoblog.com" title="WonkoBlog" target="_blank">WonkoBlog</a> for -- you guessed it -- <a href="http://wonkosphere.com" title="WonkoSphere - political blog tracking" target="_blank">WonkoSphere</a> posted <a href="http://wonkoblog.com/?p=109" title="WonkoBlog - Who is your ideal supporter?" target="_blank">a little quiz</a> about the ideal supporter today.  I figured I'd respond with what sort of supporter (of a political candidate) I am.  Would anyone want me?
<ol>
	<li>b.  I don't even know what a straw poll is.  If they had strawberries, though, I'd be there. (just kidding)</li>
	<li>a.  Much closer to (a), though obsession about a candidate is something I lack.</li>
	<li>b.  I don't roll that way.  Plus you get tazered 18 times by cops so the opponent isn't forced to listen to you exercising your liberty of free speech.</li>
	<li> c.  Doesn't give money except to charity.</li>
</ol>
So the thing I will do that I think should be on the poll is <em>VOTE</em>.  And I'll be voting in the primary for Dennis Kucinich.
