<p align="justify">The dog park over winter has no operating water fountains, so we either have to bring in water or find it.  Willow prefers to find it.  Granted, she was really hot (and thirsty) after our first round of frisbee.  School is just about over (minus one final) so I've been working from home for the past couple days.  The result is that my dog obsession is peaking again.</p>
