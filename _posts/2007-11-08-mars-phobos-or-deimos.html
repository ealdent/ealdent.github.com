<p align="justify">Which will be the newest extraterrestrial body humans will set foot on?  (Aside from the moon, of course.)  According to Pascal Lee of the <a href="http://www.marsinstitute.info" target="_blank">Mars Institute</a>, "[Phobos and Deimos] are the most accessible planetary bodies in our solar system."  New Scientist has <a href="http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn12898-marss-tiny-moons--one-small-step-for-mankind.html?feedId=space_rss20" target="_blank">a report</a> on the conference at Ames Research Center on Wednesday where ideas were thrown around for the human exploration of Mars.  Astronauts could set foot on one of them within a decade.  So cool.</p>
<p align="justify">Phobos and Deimos are similar in nature to C-type asteroids.  Phobos is porous and has an extremely low orbit, subjecting it to tidal forces.  These forces will eventually cause it to either break up or crash into Mars (in about 30-80 million years).  In the meantime, it would make an excellent base of operations for a manned mission to Mars.  Escaping the gravity of Phobos or Deimos would be much less difficult than escaping that of Mars.</p>
<p align="justify">One of the biggest problems with such a venture according to the New Scientist article is dust.  With such a weak gravitational field, Phobos could have as much as 5 meters of dust accumulated on its surface.  Also, a long journey like this would expose astronauts to too much radiation, giving them a 5% chance of dying of radiation poisoning (above the 3% NASA allows).  But wouldn't it be cool, to stand there on that dusty rock, a mere 6000 miles above Mars, looking at that giant red orb in the sky?</p>
