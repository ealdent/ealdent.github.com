My friend John (<a href="http://wrathfuldove.org" title="The Wrathful Dove" target="_blank">the Wrathful Dove</a>) pointed me to <a href="http://www.blackagendareport.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=305&Itemid=34" title="Barack the Warmonger" target="_blank">a great article</a> today about Barack Obama, who is turning into quite the warhawk.  This comes as no surprise.  All of the mainstream candidates are clones of <strong>W</strong> with a different set of pretty noises to placate one special interest or another (be those the religious right, gays, fiscal conservatives, pro-abortion, wev).  War is a business and big business backs all of the mainstream candidates.  By pocketing them all, they ensure a win-win.

Obama will also add another 100k troops to the military.  Now this would be quite an accomplishment, but one that is possibly attainable since <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/10/washington/10cnd-recruit.html?_r=1&hp&oref=slogin" title="Army Tops Its July Recruiting Goals - New York Times" target="_blank">the army surpassed its July recruitment goals</a>.  Whether this level of recruiting will be sustainable remains to be seen.  With the way people refer to Obama as JFK, MLK and Jesus come again all rolled into one, he may be able to inspire the masses to leap to their deaths in the fiery waves of nuclear hell he could very well plunge them into.  I doubt it will ever come to nukes though.  I suspect the real death awaiting these new recruits will be a small random ambush in some village halfway around the world while carrying out this endless war.  Or to their own weapon years later as they struggle in vain with the lasting psychological damage they endured.
<blockquote>"If we have actionable intelligence on Al Qaeda operatives including bin Laden and president Musharraf who cannot act, then we should."</blockquote>
Now, Obama said this during the debate recently.  Clinton's response put him in his place, but also betrays the fact that she is no different:
<blockquote>"I think it is a very big mistake to telegraph that and to destabilize the Mushareff regime, which is fighting for its life against Islamic extremists, who are in bed with al-Qaeda and Taliban. ... So, you can think big, but remember, you shouldn't always say everything you think if you're running for president because it can have consequences across the world, and we don't need that right now."</blockquote>
For one thing, <a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/08/07/307881.aspx" title="Obama vs. Clinton over Pakistan" target="_blank">MSNBC</a> cannot decide whether to spell the name of the Pakistani Prime Minister as <em>Musharraf</em> or <em>Mushareff</em>.  The second thing is that Clinton doesn't denounce the plan because it is clearly warmongering.  She denounces it because it is strategically stupid.  The good news here is that Clinton is not a blind fool, if we should be cursed with her presidency.  The bad news is the same as it has always been.   If a mainstream candidate wins, we'll be mired in this endless war at least until 2013.

Finally, Clinton acknowledges the fact that candidates can have an impact on the world even at this early stage.  Is anyone surprised then that the media is silencing the candidates who are proclaiming peace?

Another reason I support <a href="http://www2.kucinich.us/" title="Dennis Kucinich for president" target="_blank">Dennis Kucinich</a>.
