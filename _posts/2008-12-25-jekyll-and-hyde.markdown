title: Jekyll and Hyde

I have settled on the decision of migrating my blog engine from [WordPress.com][:wordpress] (WPC) to [Jekyll][:jekyll].  There are a number of disadvantages of using WPC that have been bothering me, but the alternatives weren't much better.  One option I had was to share a slice with a couple friends running [WordPress.org][:wporg], but the tradeoff between WPC and WPO were not enough to really justify that.  I'll describe Jekyll after going through some advantages and disadvantages I'm currently facing.

### Advantages of WordPress.com

+ Extra traffic driven by tags pages.
+ Basic SEO is taken care of.
+ Mostly free, with just having to pay for upgrades (domain names, custom CSS, extra storage).
+ Upgrades, maintenance, and security are not my concern.
+ Pretty sweet control panel.

### Disadvantages of WordPress.com

+ Inability to use JavaScript of any kind.
+ Can't use custom plugins or widgets.
+ Supported widgets either suck or are for websites I've never heard of.
+ Cost for things like custom CSS exceed their value.
+ Minor things like being able to use Feedburner to serve my RSS feed in a convenient, non-hackish way.
+ Not really easy to do offline editing.
+ Data is hidden away in a database I have no control over.
+ The 2.7 dashboard conflicts with some hotkeys I use for Firefox and I have deleted large swaths of text resulting in bellows of "WTF?!"

### Why WordPress.org isn't ideal

+ Written in PHP, which I know but am no longer fond of.
+ Requires semi-serious web hosting service that would have to be paid for.
+ Offline editing is still an issue.



I have been thinking of moving my blog for a while, but I hadn't chosen which engine would really suit me best.  I kicked around the idea of Blogspot as my main one, since it still has some nice layouts and lets you use javascript, while WPC does not.  I also considered the option of getting sharing a slice with some friends who host their own WordPress.org (WPO) blogs.  That was much more appealing and I almost went down that path, but WPC offers some extra traffic incentives (by being listed on the tags pages) that you can't get otherwise.  WPC has their basic SEO  stuff down and I get a steady stream of Google traffic.  Another advantage of WPC is the pretty detailed control panel you get.  Version 2.7 brought some very nifty UI enhancements and it runs a lot faster (for me) than it used to.

There are also many disadvantages of using WPC.  The main one is
the complete inability to use JavaScript.  This has been persistently annoying to me.
I would like to add some stuff now and then and WPC locked me into a very small subset
of aging widgets, most of which are for websites I've never heard of.  This is the single
greatest failing of WPC in general and they would benefit from expanding their functionality
in this arena.
