Well, the Northwest Passage is opening up as the northern polar ice cap melts away to oblivion (photo credits ESA).  The Northwest Passage is the yellow line.  All the trouble so many people went through back in the 19th Century and earlier to find a way through.  So many dead.  All they had to do was wait, it turns out.   Scientists are expecting ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean sometime around 2030.  This summer, the total ice is over 1 million square miles less than the average ice cover.<a href="http://ealdent.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/northwestpassage.jpg" title="The Northwest Passage has opened up this summer (yellow)  Credits: ESA">

I wonder what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Franklin" title="Sir John Franklin - Wikipedia" target="_blank">Sir John Franklin</a> would say if he could see this.  Probably something like, "Full steam ahead!"  I have an odd taste for folk music dealing with the sea, especially when it deals with stuff from the 19th century or earlier.  This probably is derived from a certain nostalgia I have for when the world of science was young and the future was brighter and less scary.  I suspect this is part of the reason I love steampunk so much.  Anyhow, one song I like in particular, by Stan Rogers is "Northwest Passage":
<blockquote>"<em>Ah, for just one time I would take the Northwest Passage
</em><em>To find the hand of Franklin reaching for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaufort_Sea" title="Beaufort Sea">Beaufort Sea</a></em><em>
Tracing one warm line through a land so wide and savage
</em><em>And make a northwest passage to the sea."</em></blockquote>
