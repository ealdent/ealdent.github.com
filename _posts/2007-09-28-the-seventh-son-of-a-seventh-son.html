I read <em>The Dark is Rising</em> by Susan Cooper a few years ago at the insistence of my ex-brother-in-law.  It was one of his favorite books from his childhood and I believe he put it near the level of <em>The Chronicles of Narnia</em> and <em>Lord of the Rings</em> (but not quite).  I figured that was bloody high praise, but waited a while before I got around to it.  I'm not above reading kids books and seeing kids movies.  Especially when they promise to be dark.  I love dark fantasy.  So anyhow, I enjoyed the book, though there were parts that were a little slow.

And now of course, there is a movie coming out next Friday.  I'm curious how well they will pull it off.  I never read the whole series, but in the first book there was a lot of mystery about the back story.  Hopefully they won't destroy that feeling.
