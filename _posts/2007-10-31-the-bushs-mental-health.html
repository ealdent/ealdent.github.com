Dennis Kucinich is not afraid to say the thing many people are wondering.  Is Bush freakin nuts?  Does he really think World War III is going to break out if Iran gains the <em>knowledge </em>of how to make nuclear weapons?  Who are the sides?  The middle east versus the rest of the world?  Oh and North Korea.  Plus a couple countries in Africa so embroiled in their own civil wars, they'd be lucky to send 100 men to fight off this giant.

<a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/10/31/kucinich-questions-bushs-mental-health/" target="_blank">CNN's political ticker</a> has this:
<blockquote>â€œI've told people that, if you're interested in avoiding World War III, it seems like you ought to be interested in preventing them from having the knowledge necessary to make a nuclear weapon," Bush said at a news conference earlier this month.

The Democratic presidential candidate later said <strong>he does not consider questioning the Bush's mental health inappropriate</strong>, according [to] the <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20071030_Kucinich_Time_question_Bushs_mental_health.html">Inquirer's Web site</a>. [emphasis mine]</blockquote>
I'm about 99.9999% sure that any nuclear weapon Iran acquired would be used for one purpose and one purpose only:  deterrence.  What Bush is actually saying here is  "if you're interested in avoiding a US invasion of your country, it seems like you ought to be interested in getting a nuclear weapon."  He really can't see the connection between posturing to <em>overthrow a government</em> and that government's desire to acquire a nuke to prevent that?  This version of diplomacy is like the battered wife who kills her husband in order to escape.  Only this husband thinks the wife is going to get a gun and is trying to kill her first.

As usual, Kucinich is the only one brave enough to speak out against this looming evil.  The rest are off scrambling around in the dirt for the pennies tossed at them by the corporate patrons.  Pelosi can barely look up long enough from the feast of pork-in-a-barrel to notice.

On a side note, I like the CNN editor's rendering of the bolded sentence above.  That's a direct quote as of 10:00am Eastern time.
