<p align="justify">I discovered the <code>java.util.Properties</code> class a couple weeks ago in the ginormous Java API docs.  If you've ever created a software project where you have a lot of different settings that change frequently, this is the class for you.  In my research, I implement all these different algorithms for various things, find out they don't work, implement something else, rinse, repeat.  Being able to look back at my results from two months ago and then loading the exact same configuration and running the experiment all over again is a must.  Enter the <code>Properties</code> class.<!--more--></p>
<p align="justify"><strike>So this is new in version Java SE 6 (according to the javadocs at least).</strike>  This has been around since JDK 1.0 (<em>update, see comments</em>).Â  I had originally written my own program to do this.  That was nice, but time-consuming and annoying.  This class is more thorough, robust, and flexible.  Basically you just create a text file (assuming you want to load from file) with properties in the following format:</p>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">Property = Value</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="justify">The javadocs describe a couple of different viable formats, but I don't use them.  This style is cleaner and more intuitive than the others in my opinion.   To load your properties (the class is just an extension of a <code>HashTable</code>) after creating your <code>Properties</code> object <code>prop</code> with the default constructor, just throw the following in a try-catch block:</p>
<code>prop.load(new FileInputStream("path-to-your-file"));</code>
<p>You then access properties with the appropriately named <code>getProperty</code> and <code>setProperty</code> methods (which work the same as get and put for <code>Map</code>s.  I use a singleton class to load my properties.  This way, the properties are universally accessible to all my classes without having to keep loading the file again and again.</p>
Enjoy!
