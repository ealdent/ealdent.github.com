So awesome.  I've been very skeptical of the prospects for this most delicate of industries:  space tourism.  It seems like it's probably just one catastrophe away from being set back 20 years or more.  Seeing the artist's rendition (below) of Spaceport America sets afire something in me that has lain dormant since my childhood:  hope.  Hope that I may go into space one day.  Hope that there will be a colony of people living on the moon, in a space station, on an asteroid, on Mars.  Is it a sign of my nerdiness that I have to hold back tears?
