<p>The lack of posts lately is due to the semester winding down.  And by winding down, I mean grinding me up.</p>
<p>So in lieu of something substantive, here is <a href="http://www.toymania.com/customcorner/cc19/sw2.shtml" target="_blank">another re-envisioning of Star Wars</a>.  I posted about <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2008/03/30/steampunk-death-star/" target="_self">Steampunk Star Wars</a> a couple weeks ago, but this one is slightly more recent -- taking its inspiration from World War II.  Boba Fett and the Stormtrooper are my favorites.  I can imagine a Death Star (not featured) that looks like a giant steel ball with steel panels bolted together.  The weapon dish would be steel mesh.  Many antennae would protrude from the poles.</p>
