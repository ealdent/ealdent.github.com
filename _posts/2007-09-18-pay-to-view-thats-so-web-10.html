As someone who has been getting the <em>New York Times</em> headlines by email everyday since 9/11, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/media/18times.html?ex=1347768000&en=88011ab45717e39d&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink" title="New York Times to end pay-to-view service" target="_blank">announcement </a>to get rid of their archaic pay-to-view Times Select service is great news.  Duncan Riley over at <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/18/the-end-of-the-pay-for-content-model-is-nigh/" title="TechCrunch - End of the Pay for Content Model is Nigh" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a> thinks this will herald the end of an age when content wasn't free (aka Web 1.0).  The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> was recently acquired by News Corp, so speculation has been running high that the owners of MySpace will wise up to the new world order of the intertubes and kill their pay for content service too.

While this would be a good thing, it really won't impact me all that much since I would only have read the occasional story locked behind the <em>Times</em>' barricade.  I don't read the WSJ at all (possibly because it's pay-to-view), so that won't affect me either.  What I want to see lose their pay-to-view statuses are science magazines like <em>Scientific American</em> and <em>New Scientist</em>.  These guys are still clutching onto this old model like a drowning man on a life preserver.  As Duncan pointed out, you can still make money without imposing these draconian restrictions.
