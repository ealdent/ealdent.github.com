There are a disturbing number of Jason Michael Adamses in the world.  Two years ago, I tried googling myself and gave up after 20 pages.  Using searches that included schools I went to yielded two math competitions from high school in <a href="http://bigcheese.math.sc.edu/contest/1992/results1992.html" title="1992 USC Math Competition Results" target="_blank">1992</a> and <a href="http://www.math.sc.edu/contest/1994/results1994.html" title="1994 USC Math Competition Results" target="_blank">1994</a> where I ranked in one and my team ranked in the other.  Now I am proud to announce that I have made it to page 2 for the search "Jason Adams".  Woot!  And "Jason M. Adams" puts me on page 1.  I don't know why I care about this since I'm the only one liable to search for myself.  I'm very happily married so I'm not out dating, which is probably the main purpose of googling.  I guess people might also google me when I make stupid comments on other blogs.  Maybe I care because it's like being on TV.  You might not want to admit that you want to see yourself inanely answering a question on the 6 o'clock news about Mother's Day cards just after you were ambushed at a local Wal Mart, but you rush home and program your DVR.

On a side note, my friend <a href="http://melinda.theweatherses.org" title="Melinthropy - Melinda Weathers" target="_blank">Melinda</a> clued me in on the term Googlewhackblatt.  A Googlewhackblatt is a single word that has only one search result on Google.  There is perhaps some debate whether additional search results that were omitted (because they come from the same site and the same link on that site) might nullify Goolgewhackblatt status.  My contention is no.  If the primary search returns 1 of 1 results, it's a GWB (I'm getting tired of typing it out).  So anyhow, Mendicant Bug is not a Googlewhack (when it's two words instead of one).  Obviously it's not anymore since I've been blogging under that title, but even when I started there were search results like "... mendicant. [BUG] 2006-04-31" etc.  I couldn't find any uses of the term that were in the same sentence, though, so decided to go with it.

Another thing that has gotten me excited is finding search terms that put me very close to the top on Google.  I've compiled a short list.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=blagoblag&btnG=Search" title="search blagoblag on google" target="_blank">blagoblag</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22evil+politicians%22&btnG=Search" target="_blank">"evil politicians"</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=dogbook+parks&btnG=Search" target="_blank">"dogbook parks"</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22language+technologies+institute%22&btnG=Search" target="_blank">"language technologies institute"</a> (this is my academic home page)</li>
	<li>"nasa slogan" (i was #2 a couple days ago, but more popular sites have dominated me)</li>
</ul>
So anyhow, if you're bored out of your mind and find more, let me know.
