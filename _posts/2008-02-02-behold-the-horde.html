<p align="justify">If there ever is a robot uprising, I fear I may be at ground zero.  In a case where reality mirrors art (kinda sorta), Carnegie Mellon researchers (including <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~seth/" target="_blank">Seth Goldstein</a>) are <a href="http://technology.newscientist.com/article/dn13244-shapeshifting-robot-form%0As-from-magnetic-swarm.html" target="_blank">working on a swarm of small robots</a> held together by magnetic fields.  This will allow them to take on just about any shape.  Of course, this is still a long ways off.  What Seth et al are currently working on is a control strategy for said microbots.  This touches on one of the most fascinating aspects of computer science to me:  <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/category/emergent-behavior/">emergent behavior</a>.  Imagine designing an algorithm that will allow a swarm of small robots to do (collectively) a complex task with each robot only obeying simple rules.  Good times!</p>
<p align="justify">But I would be remiss in my duties if I failed to point out the amusing end-of-the-world aspects of this particular bit o' research.   Seth says:</p>

<blockquote>"I'll be done when we produce something that can pass a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test" target="ns">Turing test</a> for appearance.  You won't know if you're shaking hands with me or a claytronics copy of me."</blockquote>
<p align="justify">Seth, I think we'll all be done when that day comes.  Build a thousand of these claytronic cylons and they will overthrow the world's most powerful military government (aka USA) in a few short hours.  Once the danger has been identified, the following dialogue might ensue at the White House:</p>

<blockquote>The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs says, out of breath, "Madame President, what are your orders?"

"Declare immunity to the <em>Homo claytronae</em> and stand down all forces."

"Wha-?"

The Secretary of State steps forward, face rippling, "You heard her.  Now on your knees, meatsack."</blockquote>
Ahh.  A boy can dream.
