<p align="justify">I go through my spam everyday to make sure that false positives don't get deleted.  For whatever reason, stuff coming from the Help Desk at CMU gets labeled as spam a lot.  I'm not saying it sounds like <i>word salad</i> (*cough*), but it trips off gmail's spam sensors.  The good thing about gmail is a low false negative rate, the bad thing is a fairly high false positive.Â  And if you weren't already aware, <i>word salad</i> is the name given to the jumble of unrelated, often obscure words that appear in a spam email to throw off spam filters.</p>
<p align="justify">The various spam messages I get never fail to amuse me in some way, so why not share them with you, my innocent reader would rather never see another spam title again?  Ages ago, I was especially amused by two bits of spam that actually had lines from <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/09/19/robert-jordan-dies/">Robert Jordan's <i>Wheel of Time</i></a> series as subject lines.  I captured an image of the second one, but the first is lost forever and I haven't noticed one since (click on it if it's too small to read).</p>

So the inaugural Spam of the Day (SOTD, rhymes with <i>sotted</i>):
