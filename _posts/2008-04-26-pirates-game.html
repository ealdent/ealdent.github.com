<p>We went to a Pittsburgh Pirates game tonight.  They got their asses handed to them by the Phillies.  It was so sad.  Donna's brother and his wife were visiting and their husky has separation anxiety.  In the 7th inning, we got a call from our neighbor that an old woman came around complaining and saying she was going to call the cops.  Our dogs are normally pretty quiet, but the husky was in a new situation and away from her owners, so poor thing was going nuts.</p>
<p>Got a pic of the parrot mascot at the game.  Proof that I occasionally watch sports.</p>
