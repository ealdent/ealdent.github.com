<p align="justify">This T-shirt just cracked me up:</p>

<p align="justify">Of course, it actually could have been this way.  I think the US even had a defacto assumption that the moon was ours.  This is very much not the case.   With the recent Japanese and Chinese probes to the moon, the upcoming German probe, and rumors of more probes and missions to the moon, there are many claimants.  There was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_Treaty" target="_blank">Moon Treaty</a> that was supposed to hand control of all heavenly bodies over to the international community (that is, the UN).  However, this useless piece of paper was only ratified by the likes of Mexico, France, India, Chile, Australia, and the Phillipines (and several other small countries), none of which have a manned space program.</p>
<p align="justify">The moon is potentially <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/1283056.html?page=4" target="_blank">a gold mine</a> (or rather, a helium-3 mine).  What it is not, is a waste of time.  If we ever do manned exploration of other worlds, a lunar base would be a great base of operations.  For one, it's good practice.  For another, the lower lunar gravity could allow people to reside there longer with slightly reduced health effects while still providing an easy base to launch from.  Of course, the moon has its dangers.  NASA <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/moonmars/features/troutman-architecture.html" target="_blank">is planning</a> <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/12/061204-moon-base.html" target="_blank">a new lunar base</a> on the lunar pole, where danger from solar radiation is diminished while still allowing for energy gathering from solar arrays.</p>
<p align="justify">It will be interesting to see how things turn out on the moon.  Will there be borders and bases manned by robots and people from many different countries?  Or will we see international cooperation as we have seen with the space station?  At this point, it's anyone's guess.</p>
