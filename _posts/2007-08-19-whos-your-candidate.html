If you don't know which candidate agrees with you most, there is a great blind test that will match you with the candidate who most agrees with you (link sent to me by my good friend at <a href="http://wrathfuldove.org" title="The Wrathful Dove" target="_blank">the Wrathful Dove</a>).  You simply indicate whether you Support/Oppose/Other an issue and then whether that issue is no big deal (meh), important, or key.  The test was quite accurate for me in choosing my top two, which I suppose is confirmation that I choose my candidate based on the issues.Â  I'm curious to see who really does agree with most Americans.
