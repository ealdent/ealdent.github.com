Reuters is reporting that <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSN0722052620070907" title="House passes patent reform bill" target="_blank">the House passed a patent reform bill</a> that aims to address a lot of problems in the current patent system.  The Senate has a similar bill up for vote sometime soon.  While it doesn't address all <a href="http://lpf.ai.mit.edu/Patents/against-software-patents.html" title="against software patents by the league for programming freedom" target="_blank">the points</a> laid out by the League for Programming Freedom back in 1991, it does at least advance things a bit.  Of course the final law that is (maybe) passed will probably be even weaker and more useless, as is usual for Congress.  I'll list some brief details in a minute, but at first glance when companies like Google, Apple, and Yahoo! all <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8b70ad3a-5d90-11dc-8d22-0000779fd2ac.html" title="patent reform bill on financial times" target="_blank">support it</a> and companies like General Electric, 3M and Johnson &amp; Johnson oppose it -- I think that's a good thing.

Ars Technica <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070907-patent-reform-act-close-to-vote-google-and-others-weigh-in-on-changes.html" title="patent reform bill highlights on ars technica" target="_blank">sums up</a> some of the main points quite nicely:
<ul>
	<li>First to file:  America will join the rest of the world and leave behind the current first to invent process</li>
	<li>Publication of all patents:  most patents must be published within 18 months of being filed</li>
	<li>Damages:  the amount of damages will be calculated based on the component being infringed instead of the value of the entire system</li>
	<li>Post-grant review:  companies now have the chance to have a patent struck down within one year of being granted through a new review process</li>
	<li>Tax planning patents:  patents on business practices that were intended as a way to reduce the tax burden -- no more</li>
	<li>Venue shopping:  infringment cases will no longer be filed anywhere the infringing company does business but only in the district where the plaintiff is headquartered</li>
</ul>
Well, hopefully this will cut back on the number of patent trolls trundling through the software jungles.
