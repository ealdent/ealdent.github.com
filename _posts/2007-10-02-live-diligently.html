If you're like me and live in fear of Alzheimer's, you probably always keep an eye out for anything you can do to "avoid it."  Of course, there are no guarantees, but things like learning a second language or changing your routines periodically are recommended.  So <a href="http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2007/10/02/alzheimers_hea.html?category=health&guid=20071002113030&dcitc=w19-502-ak-0000" title="Discover News - Driven people avoid alzheimers more" target="_blank">an article </a>in Discovery News caught my eye today, talking about a study of elderly people that shows that those who see themselves as "self-disciplined, organized achievers" have a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's.  Even more amazing to me is that some of the dutiful people examined after death had brain signs indicative of the disease but showed no dementia during life.

Of the people studied, those scoring the highest on the <em>conscientious</em> spectrum had an 89% lower chance of developing dementia than the people with the lowest scores for conscientiousness.  So, get a haircut, get a real job and stop being a bum! :)
