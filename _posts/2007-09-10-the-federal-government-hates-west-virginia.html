A few weeks ago, I talked about <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/08/24/west-not-so-virgin-ia/" title="West Not-so-Virgin-ia">mountaintop removal mining</a> and how it was raping West Virginia's mountains.  Wired has posted <a href="http://www.wired.com/science/planetearth/multimedia/2007/09/gallery_mountaintop_mining" title="Wired - Gallery of images relating to mountaintop removal mining" target="_blank">a gallery</a> including some pictures before and after.  And of course, now the government has recently announced regulations to allow more mountaintop removal mining and to allow it closer to streams.  So, luckily for West Virginia residents, they will be able to have more waste in their water, more flooding, and a state that is starting to resemble a wasteland.  At first I thought it odd that an administration that WV voted for twice would turn around and hurt its people, but then I figured W is thinking two things:  1) some of that  -- whatchamacallit -- nature is only good if ya'll can strip it down and use it to make money, and 2) they didn't vote for daddy back in '88 and '92.   If only they hadn't voted for W in 2000, the election would've gone the other way.  I guess every choice has consequences.
