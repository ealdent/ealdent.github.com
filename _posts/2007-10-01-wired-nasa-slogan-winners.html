Wired has <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/10/and-the-winner-.html" title="Wired - NASA slogan winners" target="_blank">announced the winners</a> of the NASA slogan contest they were running a while back.  As I said in <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/09/07/new-nasa-slogan/" title="New NASA Slogan" target="_blank">a previous post</a>, I made a submission, but not long after doing that I <strike>soon</strike> regretted it.  My choice of slogan was more of a sci-fi joke, so had no chance.  I thought it was at least mildly amusing, but it got voted down pretty harshly, so apparently not.
<p align="center">"Earth is not room enough."</p>
So the winners were announced today and they aren't bad.  The top 3 are:
<ol>
	<li> Exploring Other Worlds, Understanding Our Own</li>
	<li>NASA: Explorers Wanted</li>
	<li>NASA: Bringing the Universe to Your Doorstep</li>
</ol>
Well, they aren't great.  The first choice is definitely my favorite of the three.  They also listed the entire top 25, but I won't reproduce them all here.  My favorites of those are:
<ul>
	<li> Fueling Imagination</li>
	<li> Innovation Through Exploration</li>
	<li> The Universe is Waiting</li>
</ul>
And my favorite amusing entry:
<ul>
	<li> Ad Astra, Per Asparagus</li>
</ul>
