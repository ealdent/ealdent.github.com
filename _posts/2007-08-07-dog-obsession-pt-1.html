I mean, aren't they just crazy cute?  Unfortunately they are also crazy.  Willow has been dividing her time between dropping balls at my feet, pestering Daedalus (which makes him squirbble like mad), and trying to dig under our couch.Â   Balls keep rolling under there, so when she's bored, regardless of whether there's actually a ball there, she tries to claw her way under the couch.
