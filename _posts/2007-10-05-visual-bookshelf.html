Ever since Facebook added apps, there has been a gradual bloat on profiles.  Some people are app minimalists, adding just a couple things that don't clutter up their profile.  From my quite informal perusal of Facebook, these people seem to be fairly inactive users.  They log every once in a while, but don't seem to be using it on a daily basis.  Then you have your Facebook app junkies.  I'm thinking of <a href="http://www.wheresmystapler.net" title="Where's my stapler?" target="_blank">one friend</a> in particular.  Yeah, that's right.  I just outted you.  My friend, you are a Facebook app junkie.  But I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it.  Some of my best friends are like that.  It's just not how I roll.

But I have noticed that as time progresses, there is a gradual app bloat in my profile.  I've tried to keep it down as much as possible, but then Pandora comes out with their app, which is cool.  Dogbook is an essential.  The makers of Dogbook are coming out with Babybook, which I won't be using since Dogbook and Babybook are synonymous for me.  Another of my favorite apps was the Books app.  I liked being able to display some of the things I've read and rate them and compare them to friends, there were just two problems.
<ol>
	<li>The books app is hard as <em>hell</em> to use.</li>
	<li>No one is using.  Not my friends anyway.</li>
</ol>
So now I've tried out Visual Bookshelf and it seems we have a winner.  The benefit of it is that it automatically presents you with Amazon results for your nationale (assuming you're in one of the five non-US countries they support).  So instead of having to enter ISBNs or names and then going through a lengthy addition process, you just click "read it" or "want to read it" or "reading it now" and the book is in your profile.  Very handy and it recommends a book to you after you add one, which lets you add an entire series pretty quickly and easily, which is good for me since I read several fantasy series.

The only thing it seems to be missing is a "skip book" option.  If you don't want to read it, but you want the next recommendation, you're out of luck.  I'm hoping they'll fix that soon, though.
