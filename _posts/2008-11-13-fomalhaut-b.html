<p>Hubble <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2008/13nov_fomalhaut.htm" target="_blank">has captured</a> a visible-spectrum image of a planet revolving around Fomalhaut.  Previously planets had only been observed indirectly, such as when the planet passes between Earth and the star.  Fomalhaut is close enough that Hubble was able to catch a glimpse of the highly reflective giant planet, which is about three times the size of Jupiter and tens times as far from Fomalhaut as Saturn is from the sun.</p>
