<p>I don't have a lot to say about the mechanics behind it, since I'm not privy to them, but my former project GWAP is testing out a gender guesser.  Based on your preferences for 10 pairs of images, it seems to achieve decent accuracy guessing your gender.  At least of the 10 or so times that I took it, it got it wrong twice.</p>
