<a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070816143807.htm" title="Process for how memory is erased and stored has been discovered" target="_blank">ScienceDaily</a> is reporting that some scientists have managed to erase some long-term memories of tastes from rats.  These were the oldest memories ever removed purposely.  The researchers also discovered that the brain actively maintains memories and failure to do so results in memory loss.  There is still a lot of work to be done before this translates into a viable therapy of any sort.  With the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Story?id=2964509&page=2" title="Propranolol" target="_blank">recent media hype</a> about traumatic-memory-erasing drugs as treatment for victims of PTSD, this will no doubt find a use in therapy.  Why be shackled with the memory of Uncle Herb molesting you?  Just zap it.

Of course, the rest of your brain and personality are wired around these memories.  What if we removed all memory of an event that shaped your entire life around itself?  The rest of your memories, of your life curling around this event and its aftermath, are all intact.  The cornerstone gone, does the part of your personality that was changed by this event begin to unravel and you return to a previous point of equilibrium?  Or do you just go on unchanged, but haunted by something you can't quite remember.

Another question is whether memory is stored recursively.  Let's say I told you about this event in my life yesterday.  Today I have memory of that event erased.  I can still remember telling you about the event, but will I remember what it was exactly that I told you?  If so, then the memory has been copied and still exists, just now I remember it from a different perspective (perhaps in a degraded state).  Or does the brain store a pointer to the memory and so when the original memory was erased I can remember telling you about something but not what it was?  (Assuming you don't just segfault)

It seems to me that this discovery is the gateway to a terrible dystopia predicted time and again.  In the movie <em>Paycheck</em>, Ben Afleck's character worked on secret corporate projects that would be dangerous to remember.  At the end of his jobs, all memory of his employment was erased.  <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em> also dealt with this topic when two lovers erased memories of each other to rid themselves of the pain of their loss (I don't want to get too specific and spoil anything if you haven't seen this excellent movie).

With this technology, the government could abduct you in the night, torture, question and return you to your bed.  Much the worse for wear, you won't remember a thing.  But you will be afraid.  All in the name of national security, though, I assure you.   The evil applications are bounded only by the imagination.
