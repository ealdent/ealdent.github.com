<p align="justify">My friend Israel has a passion for helping people.  He's currently working on a grant proposal for a project to bring text alerts to farmers in so-called developing nations.  Currently, middle men come to farmers and buy their goods at prices that aren't always the going market rate.  Farmers are often isolated and so getting updated information on prices isn't easy.  The goal is to provide them cell phones (this would be done by another agency) and then to send them text messages with the latest prices.  This can be generalized to a wide variety of alerts to help people whose access to information is otherwise limited.</p>
<p align="justify">The NetSquared Mashup challenge is providing a group of non-profit projects a chance to compete for funding.  All you have to do to help is <a href="http://www.netsquared.org/2008/conference/projects/cellalert-net" target="_blank">vote for CellAlert.net to win</a>.  So, please help him out, won't you?  (Voting begins Monday March 17th.)</p>
