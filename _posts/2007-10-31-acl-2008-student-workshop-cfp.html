The Call for Papers (CFP) is out for the Student Workshop at next year's ACL (Association for Computational Linguistics) conference.  I've been playing around with a couple of side ideas, it would be nice to have something to submit to this.  We'll see.  Full CFP is below the jump.

<p>ACL 2008 Student Research  Workshop</p>
<p>June 15-20, 2008, Columbus Ohio</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call for Papers</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. General Invitation for  Submissions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Student Research Workshop is  an established tradition at ACL conferences. The workshop provides a venue for  student researchers investigating topics in Computational Linguistics and  Natural Language Processing to present their work and receive feedback.  Participants will have the opportunity to receive feedback from a general  audience as well as from panelists; the panelists are experienced researchers  who will prepare in-depth comments and questions in advance of the  presentation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would like to invite student  researchers to submit their work to the workshop. Since this workshop is an  excellent opportunity to ask for suggestions, to receive useful feedback and to  run your ideas by an international audience of researchers, the emphasis of the  workshop will be on work in progress. The research being presented can come from  any topic area within computational linguistics including, but not limited to,  the following topic areas:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>    </span>* pragmatics, discourse,  semantics, syntax and the lexicon</p>
<p><span>    </span>* phonetics, phonology and  morphology</p>
<p><span>    </span>* linguistic, mathematical  and psychological models of language</p>
