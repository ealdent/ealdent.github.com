<p>Most people have at least a passing familiarity with information trapping, if not the term itself.  That is, most people who are early adopters of new technology, technogeeks, etc.  In a nutshell, it is the practice of collecting information from the web as it happens.  Subscribing to rss feeds, setting up Google alerts, and using <a href="http://freealert.org" target="_blank">FreeAlert </a>to find free stuff on craigslist are all examples of information trapping.  If entering a query in a search engine is fishing for information, using one of these (and many other services) is setting a trap for information.</p>
<p>I think this is an area that is going to be taking off in the next few years for people in various industries that are expected to keep up with the latest trends.</p>
