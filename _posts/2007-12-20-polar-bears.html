<p align="justify">Polar bears depend on the Arctic ocean habitat for their survival and things are looking pretty grim for them with global warming, toxins in the food chain, and disturbances due to oil and gas drilling.  The US Geological Survey has said that they <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1773" target="_blank">could be extinct</a> by 2050 if we do not take steps to protect them now.</p>
<p align="justify">If you're a US citizen and you give a crap, I urge you to <a href="http://action.wilderness.org/campaign/polar_bear" target="_blank">send a message</a> to Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne to have the polar bear added to the endangered species list and some lands designated as a <i>critical habitat</i> necessary for the bears' survival.</p>
