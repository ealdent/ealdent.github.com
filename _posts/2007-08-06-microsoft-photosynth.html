While I'm not usually into endorsing anything related to Microsoft, they do appear to have a rather cool offering with Photosynth.  It uses multiple images to compile a three-dimensional representation of the subject.  I've used the firefox extension to look at the Shuttle Endeavor from many different angles and many of the pictures are high-res enough that you can zoom in and see the shuttle up close and personal.  Worth a few minutes examination, at any rate.
