Apparently I'm the last one to hear <a href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/star-wars/rocket+powered-21+foot-long-x+wing-model-actually-flies-305976.php" title="X-wing" target="_blank">about this</a> since I was the 3166th Digg, but Andy Woerner and a group of friends have built a working X-wing fighter powered by solid-fuel rocket engines.  This bad boy is 21 feet long and complete with a model R2D2.  It was set to launch yesterday.  The results were about what you'd expect.  I don't think R2 managed to eject though, poor little droid.
