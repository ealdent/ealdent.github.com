Or Mrs. Ancient Brewer Woman?

One more reason to thank God for beer.  Apparently, <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/11/071112-chocolate.html" target="_blank">beer makers</a> in Honduras 3000 years ago used cacao seeds to make their brew.  One byproduct of that process ended up being a predecessor of modern chocolate, though it tasted nothing like what we're used to nowadays.  Traces of chocolate were found on pottery fragments dated to between 1100 and 800 B.C.  I always wonder where certain foods come from.  When you have to go through an involved process to make something, don't you just have to stop and think, who the hell came up with this?  It's no surprise that the pursuit of the wonderful drink we mortals call beer led to similarly awesome discoveries.
