<p>If you want to use <a href="http://plurk.com/redeemByURL?from_uid=12298&check=-1874285239&s=1" target="_blank">Plurk</a>, but aren't ready to leave <a href="http://twitter.com/ealdent" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, I wrote <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jmadams/source/plurk.py">a little python script</a> you can use to automatically mirror your plurks on Twitter.  This will not work for response plurks, but your main plurks will be extracted and posted to your Twitter account with the prefix "plurking:" followed by your plurk.</p>

The resulting tweet looks like this:

<p><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jmadams/source/plurk.py">Download the script</a> and set it up as a cron job (or you could execute it manually).  It should work with python 2.4 and later.  It stores a plurkdb.dat file (which you should probably assign an absolute path to, depending on the behavior of cron on your system).  This file is checked every time it is run to make sure that duplicate plurks aren't being tweeted.  You should pass the following parameters on the command line (or modify the script so they are hardcoded, if you want):  &lt;twitter username&gt; &lt;twitter password&gt; &lt;plurk username&gt; &lt;plurk password&gt;.  <em>Update:  see later post on updated plurk script.Â  And like with all software, use at your own risk.
