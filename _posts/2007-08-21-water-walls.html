Now here's something that ought to be visually stunning.  Walls made of water in an outdoor cafe.  When the cafe is not in use, the roof is lowered via its piston supports.  When it is in use, a multitude of valves send sheets of water down its side to form the walls.  A computer controls all the valves so patterns can be made in the water as it flows.  Also, since some of the water will evaporate, this should reduce cooling costs.  This last point or so-called <em>advantage</em> is problematic for me.  Aren't the energy costs from pumping all this water far in excess of what it would cost to cool a conventional building of a similar size?

In any case, it should at least be beautiful and offers a new way of looking at architecture.  The <em>Digital Water Pavilion</em> will be unveiled next June at World Expo 2008 in Zaragoza, Spain.
