<p>Bit late, but I wanted to post a couple thoughts on the just-passed Thanksgiving.  My immediate family (mom and sisters) converged on my eldest younger sister's house in Durham, NC.  We had an absolutely fantastic turkey covered in some sort of fennel-based concoction, courtesy of my brother-in-law.  It was succulent.  Rapturous, even.  The trip there was frustrating.  There were numerous accidents and tons of traffic.  Much delay and cursing was to be had.  I almost gave up and wanted to turn around, but we soldiered on.</p>
<p>The biggest downer was the fact that a close family member had to be taken to the emergency room.  I won't say which, for medical privacy reasons, but it was a bit scary.  They are better now, but it will require ongoing treatment.  It wasn't food-related.</p>
<p>My sister and brother-in-law have some salt water fish, including a puffer that has grown a couple orders of magnitude since they got it.  It's slowly eating its way through the other fish in the aquarium and gets really angry when you get near it and aren't feeding it.</p>

<p>And (good gravy!) isn't this the cutest baby you've ever seen?</p>
