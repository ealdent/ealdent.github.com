<p><a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control" target="_blank">version control system</a> that has been gaining in popularity recently.  If you have heard of or used <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_blank">Subversion</a> or CVS, you are familiar with the basic principle of keeping track of changes by multiple users in a series of documents (source code, text files, etc).  One of the chief benefits of version control in software is that you can rollback in case the code has become corrupted.  It's easy to see which changes were made where and broken code can be fixed more easily than if you had no version control and had to reconstruct the working code from scratch.  Unlike Subversion and CVS, Git is a distributed version control system.  Each user has their own copy of the entire repository and history.  Branching and merging is much easier and it's extremely simple to get started.  Plus, having used all three, Git is the most fun.</p>
<p>Academic settings impose different constraints on code base management.  The goal is usually less about code quality and more about exploring possibilities.  Academic code is often quite shitty, hacked together by some grad student(s), with dozens of false starts and changes in requirements.  Trying to recreate previous experiments is often very difficult unless the grad student made previsions for such rollbacks.  And if they have, it's probably done in a way that seemed logical to the grad student at the time but is a nightmare for someone new to the project.  There are ways to avoid this, by placing more of an emphasis on software engineering, but sometimes projects are so small or short-lived that it doesn't seem feasible to trouble with that at first.  And if you don't even have a clear picture of where you are heading, it might not even be possible (though you are probably doomed to many problems in that case).</p>
<p>To help combat these issues, I will contend that every academic software project <strong>must</strong> use version control.  Git makes that easy and here's why.</p>

<h4><strong>1.  Creating the first repository is a no-brainer.</strong></h4>
To create a new repository you simply type:
<p><code>git init</code></p>

It's so easy, you can use it for <em>anything</em>.  To clone someone else's repository, just type:
<p><code>git clone git://location.of.origin.repository</code></p>
<p>Cloning is very similar to checking out in Subversion and CVS, except that you can now work completely independently if you desire.  And you can tunnel it through ssh (substitute ssh:// for git:// above), if you're worried about security.</p>

<h4><strong>2.  You can still use it while off the grid.</strong></h4>
<p>In Subversion, creating the initial repository means needing some central place where all of the code goes.  If you are collaborating with several people, chances are this repository is not on your own machine so if you cannot access the network, you cannot access the repository.  With Git, you store the entire repository and history on your own machine so even if you are off the network, you can take advantage of all of the features of having version control.</p>

<h4><strong>3.  Branch your experiments.
</strong></h4>
<p>Often the need arises to try out different approaches in academic coding.  Branching in Git is ridiculously simple:</p>
<p><code>git checkout -b new-branch-name</code></p>
<p>You can easily switch between multiple branches, merge branches, or discard them.  One approach might be to keep the main architecture stuff in your master branch (the original) and use branches for different parameters in experiments.  This will let you easily and logically separate functionality so that running an old experiment is just a matter of checking out the branch that pertained to it.  <strong>Update</strong>:  Thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/dlsspy" target="_blank">Dustin  Sallings</a> for the <a href="http://twitter.com/dlsspy/status/1031715076" target="_blank">shorter version</a> of checking out a new branch.</p>

<h4><strong>4.  Version control your paper.</strong></h4>
<p>Why use a shared folder or email to edit your paper?  You can easily create a Git repository to collaborate and merge changes.  You can quickly see who contributed what to a paper.  <a href="http://nitens.org/taraborelli/home">Dario Taraborelli</a> <a href="http://www.academicproductivity.com/2008/revision-control-for-latex-in-search-of-an-answer/">wrote about this</a> a few months ago, though his point was that you would need your collaborators to be familiar with a version control system and they usually aren't.  I am arguing that <em>they should be</em>.  On a side note, another VCS, <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/" target="_blank">Bazaar</a>, is listed as an alternative in the comments to Dario's post.</p>

<h4><strong>5.  Convert into an open source project.</strong></h4>
<p>Sourceforge has been around for a while, but the UI is absolute garbage.  There is an even better solution out there:  <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.  GitHub is free for open source projects and offers some great visualizations for helping you track the life of your open source project.  Of course, there is Google Code, which is quite nice and easy to use.  It doesn't support Git, just Subversion.  The drawback to using Google Code is that you have a lifetime max of 10 open source projects.  No such limit with GitHub.  Moving your Git repository to GitHub is also a simple matter of <a href="http://github.com/guides/fork-a-project-and-submit-your-modifications" target="_blank">forking your project</a> to GitHub.</p>
<p>Why does this even matter?  Check out <a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/" target="_blank">Ted Pedersen</a>'s <em>Empiricism is not a matter of faith</em> [<a href="http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/Pubs/pedersen-last-word-2008.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>] in the September issue of <em>Computational Linguistics</em>.  He contends that you should create academic software with the goal of releasing it.  This ensures the survivability of your project, increases the impact of your work, and allows reproducibility of your results.  Git makes that easier, n'est-ce pas?</p>

<h4><strong>6.  Keep track of your grad students.</strong></h4>
<p>Suspect your grad students are slacking?  Check the commit logs!  And now I prepare for hate mail from grad students.  However, I think that if I had this form of accountability, it would have made me more productive.  Of course, you don't need Git for this, any version control system would do.  Of all the systems I've used, Git's presentation of changes is the user-friendliest.</p>

<h4><strong>7.  Version control helps you write the paper.</strong></h4>
<p>When it comes time to write the paper, the version control logs can be used to provide a roadmap of what you have done.  Even though you probably have kept good notes, version control keeps a calendar of events that can add useful perspective (or fill in gaps when your notes are inadequate).</p>

<h4><strong>8.  Git is faster and leaner than other version control systems.</strong></h4>
<p>Because you have the complete repository on your own system, most operations are much faster in git.  Git reports an order of magnitude improvement in speed for some operations.  Git has a packed format they report uses less storage in most circumstances, as well.  Git has been reported to be <a href="http://vcscompare.blogspot.com/2008/06/git-mercurial-bazaar-repository-size.html" target="_blank">almost three times </a>more space efficient than Bazaar, another distributed version control system mentioned above.  Git also features <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html" target="_blank">an easy binary search</a> when trying to locate bugs.</p>

<h4><strong>9.  Version control makes it easier to bring new team members up to speed.</strong></h4>
<p>Speaking from experience, having a record of commits (and well documented commits) makes it easier to come up to speed on an existing project.  This applies not only to academic coding but to any coding endeavor.  Good documentation doesn't hurt either.</p>

<h4><strong>10.  Save yourself some headaches.</strong></h4>
<p>I think you'll minimize headaches if you use Git.  If not Git, at least use some version control system.  A lot of the things I listed above are covered by most version control systems, but Git combines regular advantages of version control in a way that is very friendly to non-linear coding situations.  Git also makes it a cinch to move your code into an open source project that can have a significant impact on your career as a researcher.  And Git is so easy to use, you have to ask yourself, <em>why not?</em></p>
