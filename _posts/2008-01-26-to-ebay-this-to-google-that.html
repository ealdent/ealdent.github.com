<p align="justify">There is nothing unusual about verbing nouns in English.  Despite the fact that your English teacher may have told you not to do this, it is common practice, especially on the intarwebs.  Verbing brand names to mean the primary action performed by the chief product of that brand is less common, but we all know about "googling."  Just sitting here, trying to drink my morning coffee, I couldn't come up with another example.</p>
<p align="justify">But what got me thinking about this is another example used in today's <a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20080126" target="_blank">User Friendly</a>.  One character says,</p>

<blockquote>"You're gonna <b>ebay</b> it to goths, aren't you." [emphasis mine]</blockquote>
<p align="justify">I had never heard the brand name <i>ebay</i> used in verb form, meaning to sell something on ebay (the primary function of their chief product).   It is not uncommon, though.  Searching the Google for +"to ebay it", I found that at least 10% of the top few pages of results were just this construction (versus "to ebay.  It ...").  I estimate from that there are about 19,000 uses of ebay as a verb in this context, and no doubt many others in variations (e.g. "I ebayed my watch").</p>
<p align="justify">Another example that just occurred to me, but which is pretty artificial, is <i>to twitter</i>, meaning to post something on <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.  I say this is artificial because Twitter openly encourages and suggests this terminology.  It was not an emergent construct, but an imposed one.  It has been adopted by the overwhelming majority of users, though.  [<a href="http://twitter.com/ealdent" target="_blank">follow me on twitter</a>]</p>
<p align="justify">So here is my question:  does this only work for Internet companies?  I'm probably forgetting some obvious brick-and-mortar company for which we have verbed their brand, so please tell me if I have.  Or is it that Internet companies are especially conducive to this construction because so many Internet companies start off with only one service and become known by that service.  Google is search, ebay is selling crap through auctions, twitter is ... twittering.   If this only works for Internet companies, why did we start doing it in the first place?</p>
<p align="justify">And I just came up with a brick-and-mortar example:  <i>hoover</i>.  You can hoover down a plate of food, meaning to suck something up like a champ.  But my classification still holds, that is the primary function of their chief product (or at least the main product that people know them by).  Marketing people have already taken this to heart, I'm sure.  You need an easy name that sounds like English.  <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2008/01/04/dinklefwat-5/" target="_blank">Just like with scientific terminology</a>, no one wants to Dinklefwat their dishes.</p>
