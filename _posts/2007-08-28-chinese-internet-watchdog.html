Well, Chinese internet users are getting the shaft yet again.  Beijing police are going to be putting cartoon police officers on the top Chinese web portals.  These nifty little guys will warn users that they shouldn't be looking at illegal websites.  Isn't that sweet?  We wouldn't want all those minds polluted by notions of liberty, religion, or political dissention.
