<p>My new favorite band (thank you, Pandora):  the <a href="http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/dresden+dolls" target="_blank">Dresden Dolls</a>.  The band is a Boston duo with vocals by Amanda Palmer, who is supposed to be releasing an album this year with some collaboration by Ben Folds.  They describe themselves as Brechtian (as in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertolt_Brecht" target="_blank">Bertolt</a>) punk cabaret, which actually seems to fit.  The lyrics are occasionally self-referential, often bitter and always insightful.  The music is a blend of piano, carnival music, and the 1920's.  Plus a million other things.  So cool.</p>
<p>Note, the youtube version of "Coin Operated Boy" is about a minute short.  If you can get your hands on the full version, I find it much better.  Another song I love below.</p>
