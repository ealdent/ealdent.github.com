TechCrunch just posted <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/31/google-earths-easter-egg-a-flight-simulator/" title="Google Earth's hidden feature: flight simulator" target="_blank">a story</a> about a hidden feature of <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth" target="_blank">Google Earth</a>: a flight simulator.  To get there on a PC, just hit Ctrl-Alt-A and on a Mac, it's Command-Option-A (capital <em>A</em>).  You can choose between flying an F16 or an SR22 prop plane.  The F16 is fast but the controls are a little pickier, while the SR22 is slow and more stable.

Some key commands to get you going (if you're impatient, like me):
<ul>
	<li>left/right-arrow -- ailerons left and right (this makes you roll if you're unfamiliar with aircraft terms)</li>
	<li>up/down arrow -- elevator up/down (this makes you go up or down)</li>
	<li>shift + left/right arrow -- rudder left or right (this turns you right/left)</li>
	<li>page up/page down -- increase or reduce thrust</li>
</ul>
Game play is a bit sucky, but as TechCrunch points out, the nifty feature here is the fact that you are flying over real images.  The downside, of course, is that those images aren't 3-D.  In the screenshot below, I am flying up Broadway in Manhattan approaching Central Park.
