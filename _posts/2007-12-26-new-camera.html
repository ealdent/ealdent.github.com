<p align="justify">One of the things my mother got me was a nice, little digital camera.  I didn't want something super-high quality that would cost a fortune, but I wanted something good, small and that I wouldn't have a heart attack if I broke.  I wanted something that would slip in my pocket that I can (hopefully) use for photowalking.  My cell phone has been what I've been using lately, but while it's decent for a phone, it's just not that great.  So my new 8 MP <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKodak-Optical-Digital-Camera-Silver%2Fdp%2FB0011FMZY2%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Delectronics%26qid%3D1198693661%26sr%3D8-13&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Kodak EasyShare M883</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=ur2&o=1" border="0" height="1" width="1" /> will do the trick.  I took some pictures of a bouqet of roses to play around with it.  To continue the lightweight theme, I used <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank">Picasa 2</a> from Google for the editing.  The end product is kinda cool I think.</p>

Good times.</p>
