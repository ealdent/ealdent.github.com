<p align="justify">So still in York on the Thanksgiving holiday, doing stuff with Donna's family.  Today we ate dinner with her cousin Connie and son Dillon.  They are cousins, but were really close growing up, so are more like sisters.  So to Dillon we are Aunt Donna and Uncle Jason.  He is crazy cute and strong like Bam-Bam.  He's also extremely durable.  I've never seen a kid who gets a bigger kick out of falling down, being thrown in the air, and being tossed (from short distances) onto cushions.</p>
