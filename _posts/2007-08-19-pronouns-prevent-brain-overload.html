Dr. Amit Almor of my <a href="http://www.sc.edu" title="University of South Carolina" target="_blank"><em>alma mater</em></a> and his team have used fMRI images of the brain to see just what is going on when people use pronouns versus proper nouns.  They found that the spatial area of the brain lights up when proper nouns are used, implying that the brain builds a new representation each time.  When pronouns were used, these areas did not light up.

So representations for proper nouns are <em>merged</em> as processing goes on.  However, too many of them can result in disruption in the processing of new input.  Interestingly, a similar phenomenon occurs in users of American Sign Language.  Signers point to a space in the air as a reference point for proper nouns, a function similar to pronoun usage in spoken language.  Pretty cool.

The reference to the term <em>merging</em> caught my attention.  Unfortunately, the press release does not go into detail about just how they conclude there is merging being done.  I also cannot access <a href="http://www.neuroreport.com/pt/re/neuroreport/abstract.00001756-200708060-00003.htm;jsessionid=GL6CGKl6yM2p1GZKQrnt0NcYnQhbLcPHt65P5sNlqCLLvmh67br1!-362743511!181195628!8091!-1" title="NeuroReport - What's in a name? Spatial brain circuits are used to track discourse references" target="_blank"><em>NeuroReport</em></a>, the journal where this research was published.  However, in the Minimalist Program in Chomskyan linguistics, there are two basic syntactic operations: merge and move.  One possibility is that Dr. Almor and his team are drawing on an idea from transformational grammar.  Another possibility, and probably more likely, is that they are drawing on the idea that smaller units of meaning are built into larger ones (by merging) as the sentence is parsed.  If they are getting this idea from Minimalism, I'm really curious how they justify it.  It seems like a major bit of evidence in favor of Chomsky's theories, which have not fared well in the way of biological support.
