<hr /><br />Original post can be found at:  <a href="http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2007/09/30/my-google-wishlist/" target="_blank">http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2007/09/30/my-google-wishlist/</a><br /><br />
Currently the features I want Google to add:
<ol>
	<li>add Google Scholar to search history</li>
	<li>add links for citations included in the paper for each result</li>
	<li>allow the two functions: <em>cites</em> and<em> citedby</em> for searching</li>
</ol>
<em>Note:  This is a very incomplete list, just what's pressing at the moment.</em>

Regarding (2), currently when you are presented with the papers in the search result, there is a link that looks like
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="http://ealdent.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/googlescholar1.png" alt="Google Scholar example of number of citations" /></p>
I'd like a link added that shows you results for everything this paper cites, so I don't have to open the paper and manually search for everything in there.  The link would basically say "Cites 13 articles" (or something similar).  That's not so hard, is it?

And for (3), I want to be able to search the papers that cite a particular paper or author and the papers that are cited by a particular paper or author.  There are definitely more issues that need to be worked out for this, since it would be a many-to-many explosion in the case of ill-formed queries.  Maybe just an option to narrow it down so we're searching based on a paper that was already turned up in a search.
<h3>Update</h3>
<em>Added (3) after the original post.</em>
