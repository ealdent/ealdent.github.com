<p>I think there must be literally thousands of guys with the name Jason Adams in the English speaking world.  There are many who share my middle initial (Jason M. Adams) and I've encountered several with the same middle name:  Michael.  Really, my parents couldn't have given me a more common name, and Jason was a very popular boy name at the time.</p>
<p>I think I need to change my name to stand out.  I want a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhackblatt" target="_blank">googlewhackblatt</a>.  This needs to be a unique identifier, after all.  Any suggestions?</p>
