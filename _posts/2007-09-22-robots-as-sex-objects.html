After some surfing through the tubes, I came across an ad for <a href="http://www.consumer.philips.com/consumer/consumer_landing_page.jsp?country=US&language=en&catalogType=NORELCO" title="Norelco arcitec" target="_blank">a new razor</a> from Norelco.  At first the ad seemed innocuous and I was slightly intrigued because it looks weird and I sorta need a new razor (though I've been doing without for a while now).  Then the flash animation changed and I was looking at the picture below.  I was struck by the somewhat sexual nature of the image.  It's almost as if the robot is the object of sexual desire in this ad.  If you don't agree, substitute a naked human female in its place.
