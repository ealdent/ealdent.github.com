<p>There was a gas shortage in Atlanta over the weekend, so I figured it was a good time to walk to work.  Of course, I only use about an eighth of a tank per week if I do drive.  Last week I found the path through the Greenway from my apartment to my office building, and today the car stayed home.  I couldn't have picked a better day.  The sky was crystal clear (such a change from Pittsburgh), the temperature was cool, and the sun was just above the trees.</p>
<p>On the way in, I saw three deer.  I managed to snap a pic of two of them. These two seemed especially cautious compared to the others I've come across.  The first time I walked the trail, I had both of my dogs and came across a 4-point buck.  He didn't give a crap about me or the two dogs that were snarling and barking into the trees.  It wasn't until the pre-flash from the red-eye reduction on my camera that he turned and bolted.  And then finally today on the way home I came upon two fawns without any doe in sight. They let me get about 8 feet away before darting off further into the woods. Everyday in the woods around my apartment I see at least one deer. Last night there was one rustling in the bushes and it sent Willow and Daedal into fits.  The woods are literally crawling with them. Looking for them is becoming my obsession. I think I'll probably walk tomorrow even though I'm going in almost an hour and a half earlier than usual, just so I can spot some more.</p>
<p>Anyhow, pics below.  I've also spotted two snakes and had a run-in with a copperhead.  I stepped on it and it thrashed all over my leg, but I managed to avoid being bitten.  That got the old adrenaline flowing...</p>
