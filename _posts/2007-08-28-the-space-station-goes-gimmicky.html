As a big fan of both Star Wars and the International Space Station, you would think that the upcoming marriage of the two would delight me.  You would be wrong.

Luke Skywalker's lightsaber will be flown to Houston, where it will be sent off by Chewie and a host of other minor Star Wars characters, including R2 and some stormtroopers.  Then, it will be carried along with the new Italian-built Harmony node to the space station by <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts120/index.html" title="STS-120 Discovery taking the Harmony node to the International Space Station" target="_blank">STS-120</a> (Discovery) on October 23rd.  At the end of the mission, it will be brought home and probably gain a few tens-of-thousands of dollars in value as a result.   The reason for this gimmick is the 30th anniversary of the Star Wars franchise.

I suppose the reason I hate this cheap, pointless exercise so much is that I am really angry with people not appreciating the sheer awesomeness that is the International Space Station.  Most Americans would be shocked to learn that there are currently <em>people living in space</em>.  The fact that they don't already know it says to me that something has gone horribly wrong in our national psyche.  So NASA feels the need to allow this gimmick to proceed, perhaps in hopes of increasing awareness and therefore funding.  Maybe it's not so much anger I feel as it is sorrow, for the futility I sense in trying to change the status quo with such a cheap trick.

Or maybe I'm just being way too dramatic -- a charge that has oft been levelled at me.  I will not deny it.  Probably the LucasArts people wanted to generate some buzz for their franchise and the NASA geeks, having a high probability of being devoted Star Wars fans, accepted gladly.
