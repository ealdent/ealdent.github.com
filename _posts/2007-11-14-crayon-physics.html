<p align="justify">I stumbled on this the other day.  The game is called <a href="http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/crayon/" target="_blank">Crayon Physics</a> and it's pretty much what it sounds like.  You can make a crayon drawing of simple shapes like squares and circles and curves.  The objects you create begin obeying the laws of physics (gravity and Newton's laws of motion mainly).  So a square drawn in the air falls to the ground.  A circle drawn on a slope begins to roll.  The first version is pretty simple.  On each level you have to move the ball to the star.  You can drop things on the ball to get it to roll, you can set up obstacles, build bridges, etc.  It's ingenious.</p>
<p align="justify">The <a href="http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/general/crayon-physics-deluxe-on-a-tablet-pc/" target="_blank">next version</a> will hopefully roll out soon.  No telling though since it's a guy working in his spare time.  But looks to be excruciatingly cool.Â  Watch me play one level while trying to record it on my cell phone.</p>
