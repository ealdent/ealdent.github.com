<p>Willow gets nervous when Donna leaves.  She watches her like a hawk through the window until she disappears from sight.  Today I decided to take a picture of this, which meant opening the screen as well as the window.  However, Willow started getting a little too "jumpy" and I had to tug her away from the window before she tried to learn how to fly.</p>

<p>The berries on the ground are mulberries.  We have several trees in our yard, so they are falling everywhere right now.  Daedalus is addicted to them, the little blighter.  It's a constant tug-of-war when we're outside.</p>
