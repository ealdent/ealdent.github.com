<p align="justify"><a href="http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/newstex/AFX-0013-22704409.htm" target="_blank">CNN is reporting</a> that Microsoft is making eyes at Yahoo! to the tune of $31 per share, or about $44.6 billion.  If such a deal ever materialized, it would definitely make things interesting for Google.  Personally I consider both Microsoft Live search and Yahoo to be inferior products to the Google, but two wrongs make a right, wrong? [<a href="http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2008-02-01-n63.html" target="_blank">hat tip</a>]  There has been talk the SEC might try to block such a move due to monopoly worries.  I'm not convinced there is anything to worry about, but what do I know.</p>
<p align="justify">What I <i>am</i> interested in knowing, though, is how this will affect both Microsoft and Yahoo's research arms.  Will they become bigger and better than ever or will there be some cuts?  I certainly hope the former is true.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>
<p align="justify">Check out the <a href="http://blogoscoped.com/forum/122329.html#split" target="_blank">comments on the Google Blogoscoped article</a> regarding<font color="#999999"></font> the monopoly worries.  I just read them after posting and they pretty much shoot down the idea of an SEC action on those grounds.</p>
