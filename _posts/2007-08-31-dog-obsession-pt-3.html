Whenever we make up our bed and put all the decorative pillows on it, Willow loves it.  After a night of visitors, we came into our bedroom to find Willow passed out beneath a minor avalanche.

This picture was taken with my new cell phone on the highest quality level (1600x1200).  The image was too large to send to myself via email so I bought a 1 GB micro SD card off of <a href="http://www.newegg.com" title="newegg - tech stuff for cheap" target="_blank">newegg </a>for about $12.  It's a great way to get around spending extra on picture/video messaging.  It won't be saving me anything, though, since my phone plan includes more free messages than I'm likely to ever use.
