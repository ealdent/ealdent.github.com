<p align="justify">I received this email today from Dennis Kucinich's election campaign (below the jump).  It's <a href="http://DemocracyforAmerica.com/VoteKucinich" target="_blank">a quick poll</a> where you choose your top 3 candidates (democratic) for president if you had to vote today.  So I voted Kucinich, Gravel, and Edwards.  The (optional) reason I gave was that Dennis is the only principled candidate and is neither a warhawk nor a corporate stooge.  The only thing wrong with him is that he's not good for advertising revenue and so mainstream media outlets ignore him completely.  Considering the massive load of dung that constitutes 99.9% of NBC, ABC, and CBS, 100% of CNN and 110% of Fox's news coverage, this probably isn't such a bad thing.  It should give people pause, at least, if the media allowed them to think for themselves for 8 seconds.</p>

<p align="justify">And we all know that ain't gunna happen.</p>

<p align="justify">Anyhow, please Kucinich a hand and vote for him <a href="http://DemocracyforAmerica.com/VoteKucinich" target="_blank">in that poll</a>.</p>
