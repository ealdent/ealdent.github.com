Well, I have finally decided to join the <a href="http://xkcd.com/181/">Blagoblag</a>.  This will be my second blogging attempt.  The <a href="http://www.blogigo.de/ealdent">first </a>was forced as part of one of my German classes.  I actually got into it after a while, but when the class ended, so did my enthusiasm.  I believe this confirms the fact that I am in love with anything school related.  In fact, when I was a child, <span>playing school</span> was my favorite game.  That's fairly understandable for pre-school children, but I still enjoyed it even after I started going to school.

So anyhow, I'm really writing this blog because I forget who I am every couple of years.  I hear about things I did five to ten years ago and wonder, who the bloody hell was this guy doing this crap?  So maybe here will be a record of who I was when and then I can look back over these posts and remember.
