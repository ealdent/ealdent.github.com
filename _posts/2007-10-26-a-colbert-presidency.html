Probably would not be noticeably bad.  Colbert certainly is attracting a massive amount of attention after declaring his desire to run as a candidate in South Carolina.  Whereas <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2231653698" target="_blank">Barrack Obama's facebook group</a> was haled as a success after gathering 384k+ members, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=7406420086&ref=nf" target="_blank">Colbert's group</a> skyrocketed to over a million in just one week.  So does he actually have a shot at the presidency if he decided to kick it up a notch and run in all 50?  That certainly seems to be the case with younger voters at this point, but would it hold out at the actual election?  On <a href="http://www.wonkosphere.com" target="_blank">Wonkosphere</a>, he's got a buzz percentage of about 4%, roughly one-third of the buzz for the candidates the media is telling you to vote for (Hillary and Giuliani).

Better yet, he should run in 48 states, singling out 2 as "handicap" states to give the other candidates a fighting chance.  I'm sure he could find a pair funnier than Alaska and Rhode Island, but that's a start.

Also, for a good read about why the democratic leadership isn't worth two farts in the wind, you should check out <a href="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/2007/10/pete-nancy-george-and-wwiii/" target="_blank">today's article</a> on Dissident Voice.
