<p>I have been interested in alien (invented) languages since my first brush with elven in the Lord of the Rings.  I checked out <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKlingon-Dictionary-Star-Trek%2Fdp%2F067174559X%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1208615281%26sr%3D8-1&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Klingon Dictionary</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=ur2&o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></em> from the library in high school and currently own a copy of it and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLanguages-Tolkiens-Middle-Earth-Ruth-Noel%2Fdp%2F0395291305%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1208615177%26sr%3D8-1&tag=themenbug-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">The Languages of Middle Earth</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=themenbug-20&l=ur2&o=1" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /></em>.  During high school, I nerdily amused myself by attempting to develop a language for Antarians, which involved gutturals and whistles.  Speaking it myself was nearly impossible and I would occasionally practice, trying to go from a growling sound to a whistle as quickly as my human apparatus would permit.  I imagine the average passerby might have considered calling the police to have me committed, or at least checked for rabies.</p>
<p>New Scientist has a brief article about the possibility of actually preparing for <a href="http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn13739-babelfish-to-translate-alien-tongues-could-be-built.html?feedId=online-news_rss20" target="_blank">what alien languages might be like</a>.  The argument that Terrence Deacon of UC Berkeley makes (according to the article) is that language serves a purpose.  It is a communication system for describing the world and since the world is in some way a fixed point of reference (though perception of the world is not), then abstract symbolism is a feature common to all languages.</p>
<p>At one point, the study of xenolinguistics would have been a dream job for me.  A nice office at NASA, a field that will probably never be verifiable.  Could you ask for more?</p>
