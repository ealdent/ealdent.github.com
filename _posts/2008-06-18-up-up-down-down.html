<em>This post is spoiler free.</em>
<p>I finally got to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467406/" target="_blank">Juno</a> tonight.  It's been sitting at the top of my Netflix queue for nearly two months with a long wait.  What a great movie!  One of my favorite parts was the soundtrack.  There were several great songs by Kimya Dawson (of the Moldy Peaches) and then a performance by the two leads of the Moldy Peaches song "Anyone Else But You."  The version sung in the movie is missing a few stanzas.  My favorite of the missing ones is below (sung by Kimya):</p>

<p>"Up up down down left right left right B A start
Just because we use cheats
Doesn't mean we're not smart
I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else
But you..."
</p><p>Go geek references (and Thundercats)!  And speaking of cheats, trying using that cheat code in Google Reader (minus the start button at the end of course).</p>
<p>And returning to Netflix:  they are removing individual profiles from accounts as of September 1st.  What a boneheaded, retardafreakin' idea.  Supposedly it will help them make the website better.  I hope it's <em>a lot</em> better since this change has me pissed.</p>
