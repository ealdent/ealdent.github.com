<p>I just saw <a href="http://fantasyhotlist.blogspot.com/2008/08/meme-top-48-science-fiction-adaptations.html" target="_blank">this meme on Pat's Fantasy Hotlist</a> and since he didn't tag anyone, and I've never done this sort of thing before, I figured what the heck.  Just as he tagged no one, nor will I.  This is for my fleeting amusement and as an escape from the joys of moving.  The chain-letter-like aspect of "tagging" people is somewhat repulsive to me.</p>
<p><strong>From Box Office Mojo's list of Top 48 Sci-Fi Films Based on a Book (or Story) (1980- present). Some of the titles on this list look suspicious. (Was Cocoon really based on a piece of written fiction? There's a difference between an adaptation and a novelization.)</strong></p>

<strong>Here are the rules.</strong>

<strong>- Copy the list below.
- Mark in bold the movie titles for which you read the book.
- Italicize the movie titles for which you started the book but didn't finish it.
- Tag 5 people to perpetuate the meme. (You may of course play along anyway.)</strong>

<strong>And now, the list...</strong>
