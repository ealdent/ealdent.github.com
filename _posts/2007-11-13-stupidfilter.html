Now here's a great idea.  <a href="http://stupidfilter.org/main/index.php?n=Main.About" target="_blank">StupidFilter</a> is an open-source project with the goal of rooting out and destroying stupid comments in blogs, wikis, YouTube, flickr, and just about any place morons are allowed to voice their opinions.  Pulling this off would allow me to read the comments on Flickr without wanting to rip my eyeballs out.  No longer will I gag when I accidentally allow myself to glance at the comments on a YouTube video.  Yes, the world will be a better place.

The best part will be the complaints by users who are no longer able to leave comments.
