<p>I'm considering switching to a different blogging platform.  The inability to use javascript in the hosted version of WordPress is annoying.  What do you think?</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em> I have decided to stick with WordPress.com.  After further evaluation it seems to be the best choice.  Even though I hate not being able to do some javascript stuff, ultimately it just seems to be a better platform.</p>
