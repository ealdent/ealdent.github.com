Astronomers have theorized for years that there must be more mass out there than we can see.  Based on the movements of galaxies, star systems, and gas clouds the number of stars just can't account for it all.  Enter dark matter.  Matter we can't see.  Special stuff.  Even a whole <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7017822/" target="_blank">Dark Galaxy</a>.

On a side note, I've always thought that would make the perfect penal colony for an intergalactic empire.
<blockquote>"Mr. Adams, for your crimes against the Blagoblag, you are hereby sentenced to spend the rest of your natural life exiled to ... the Dark Galaxy."

"Noooooooooo!!  Please, execute me instead!"</blockquote>
So a couple of Canadian astronomers (why their Canadaness is important, I don't know) have proposed a new theory of gravity that dispenses with the need for dark matter altogether.  From a strictly lay viewpoint, since I don't have enough of a physics background to make an informed assessment, dark matter has always struck me as <em>ad hoc</em>.  So dispensing with it would be much more elegant, in my opinion.  Of course it would mean the end of the Dark Galaxy and my dreams of a vast network of prisons for political dissidents from the Rebel Alliance.

Last summer, observation of a galactic collision in the Bullet Cluster was touted as an event that caused dark matter to separate from the regular matter in galaxies and was considered evidence of dark matter's existence.  Enter Canadian astronomers:  claims of dark matter's existence premature.  They have proposed a modified theory of gravity (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0608074" target="_blank">MOG</a>), which would account for everything observed in the collision.  Excellent.  <em>Note:  they are not announcing the theory, which has been around for a year or so, but the application of the theory to actual observed data.</em>

John Moffat, the <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=562" target="_blank">lead researcher</a>, makes a great point that mirrors my feelings about dark matter quite well.  He compares theories of dark matter to the 19th Century theory of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether" target="_blank"><em>luminiferous aether</em></a>, the hypothetical medium of space through which light was able to travel. "They saw a glimpse of special relativity,   but they weren't willing to give up the ether.   Then Einstein came along and said we don't need   the ether. The rest was history."
