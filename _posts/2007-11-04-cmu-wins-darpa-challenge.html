<p align="justify">So yesterday was the big race for the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge/overview.asp" target="_blank">DARPA Urban Challenge</a>.  The goal is to research technologies that will lead to autonomous battlefield robots that can deliver supplies while navigating traffic.  The joint Carnegie Mellon and General Motors team <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/blogs/technology_news/4229973.html" target="_blank">won</a>, completing the race with no major traffic infractions.  This strikes me as one of those technologies that in 20 years no one will realize had military origins.  We'll all happily get in our inexpensive robotic taxis running on electricity.</p>
