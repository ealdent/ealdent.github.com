<p>Well the <a href="http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/11/marsphoenixs-tw.html" target="_blank">Wired contest</a> to come up with an epitaph for the Mars Phoenix lander has ended and the final choice blows, in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote><strong>Veni, vidi, fodi. </strong>(I came, I saw, I dug) </blockquote>
The number three choice wasn't so bad:
<blockquote><strong>It is enough for me. But for you, I plead: go farther, still.</strong> </blockquote>
<p>My choice, as I <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2008/10/30/nasa-twittering/" target="_self">mentioned before</a>, was ranked at #4, so not too bad.  I scrolled down to the very end of the list and looked for the most hated epitaphs.  There were some real stinkers, to be sure, but also some funny ones.  Here are several of the turdiest:</p>

<ul>
	<li>this weather gives new meaning to the old saying, 'blue balls in a nor'easter'</li>
	<li>May he rest in peace ~~~Lance was here '69~~~</li>
	<li>Go to the light. Like great men and myths, (Elvis, Tupac, BigFoot, Nessie) your legend will live on after your tweetstream goes flatline.</li>
	<li>Better Dead on Red. The First of what will be many efforts to raise us from the mire of our own making.</li>
</ul>
