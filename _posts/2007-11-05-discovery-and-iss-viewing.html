<p align="justify">There is a somewhat <a href="http://www.space.com/spacewatch/071105-shuttle-spotting.html" target="_blank">rare opportunity</a> for people in the US and southern Canada over the next two days.  The space shuttle Discovery just undocked from the International Space Station and is currently drifting just in front of it.  It will be passing nearly overhead just before dawn, the best time for viewing.  As the space station comes into the sunlight while the Earth below is still in darkness, the solar panels reflect the light and it stands out brighter than most stars in the sky.  Both the ISS and Discovery will be visible to the naked eye.  In fact, the ISS is four times brighter than the brightest star in the sky and about equal in brightness to the planet Jupiter.</p>
<p align="justify">To see when the space station will pass overhead, check out the NASA <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/" target="_blank">Skywatch website</a>.  You can also use the most excellent real-time satellite tracking website, <a href="http://n2yo.com" target="_blank">n2yo.com</a>.  I <a href="http://mendicantbug.com/2007/10/17/track-the-space-station/">mentioned</a> this website before, and it continues to impress me.  You can create prediction maps for up to 5 days in advance, showing exactly where it will pass near you.  Tomorrow morning at 6:12am, Pittsburgh will have a very nice, nearly overhead view of the ISS and Discovery.</p>
<p align="justify">Discovery lands Wednesday around midday, so your chances for viewing are limited to Tuesday and Wednesday (Nov 6th &amp; 7th).</p>
