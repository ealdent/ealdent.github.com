The 9th annual Conference on Intelligent Text Processing and Computational Linguistics is calling for papers.  The conference will be held in Haifa, Israel from February 17-23, 2008.  Two of the keynote speakers were professors of mine last semester.  Alon Lavie works on machine translation (including for low-resource languages) and machine translation evaluation.  Kemal Oflazer was a visiting professor here at CMU last semester and advised me for a lab project on Old English morphology.  He's one of the leading proponents of finite state technology for morphological analysis and has done a lot of work with Turkish, which has a very rich morphology.

<strong> Submission Deadline</strong>: October 15, 2007.

The full CFP is given below:
