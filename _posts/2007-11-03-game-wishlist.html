<hr /><br />Original post can be found at:  <a href="http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2007/11/03/game-wishlist/" target="_blank">http://ealdent.wordpress.com/2007/11/03/game-wishlist/</a><br /><br />
<p align="justify">What I really want is a battlefield style game (such as Halo, Battlefield) but in a medieval/steampunk world.  So weapons include slow-loading muskets, crossbows, swords, bows &amp; arrows, daggers, clubs, etc.  There would be stationary siege weapons like catapults, trebuchets and scorpions.  For vehicles, there would be horses, possible fantasy creatures (but not dragons -- too powerful), ships, and air ships (like zeppelins).  And of course, this should be an MMOG.  Now someone go build it.</p>

<p align="justify">And check out David Edwards' site (image link above).  Some really cool digital art, if you're into it.  Naturally the airship is my favorite, but Sky Castle, Versity, and 3001 AD are right up there.</p>
