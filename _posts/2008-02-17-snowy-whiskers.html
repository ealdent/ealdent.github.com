<p align="justify">Willow in her natural environment.  She has taken to eating all the snow she can find.  Right now it's melting, and there is an ice path leading along the side of my apartment that is covered in water.  (Water on top, ice on bottom.)  No picture of that, though.  This is her on Valentine's Day.</p>
