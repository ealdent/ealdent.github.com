</p><p align="justify">It is a sad, sad day.  James Rigney, aka Robert Jordan, author of the Wheel of Time fantasy series passed away on September 16, 2007.  He had been battling with amyloidosis for a while now and the publisher announced he died of "complications from primary amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy."  He was working on the final book in the Wheel of Time series.</p>
<p align="justify">Robert Jordan was the first fantasy author I read and really enjoyed.  He is the reason I started reading fantasy at all.  He influenced the entire genre over the past couple decades, helping authors like George R. R. Martin get a start by providing a cover quote for his first Song of Ice and Fire book, <i>A Game of Thrones</i>.  He also provided many of the ideas for Terry Goodkind's <i>Sword of Truth</i> series, though Goodkind denies it vehemently.  All you have to do is read the books (that's not a suggestion, by the way, Goodkind is a talentless hack) to see the similarities and ideas that were pulled right out of Jordan's pages.</p>
<p align="justify">The last news I had heard from Jordan was a while back since I don't check the <a href="http://www.dragonmount.com" title="Dragon Mount - Wheel of Time fansite" target="_blank">Dragonmount</a> website frequently.  At the time, it seemed he was beating the disease with promising news from the Mayo clinic where he was getting treatment.  When I read about this today on George R. R. Martin's <a href="http://grrm.livejournal.com/21250.html" title="George R R Martin - Not a blog" target="_blank">Not a blog</a>, I was blown out of the water.  We should all go light a pipe for this once physics major turn fantasy writer who survived hurricanes and Vietnam, but was no match for the ravages of time.</p>
