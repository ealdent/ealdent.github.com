<p><a href="http://www.spore.com" target="_blank">Spore</a> is probably the most anticipated game of the year.  Indeed, it has been anticipated for quite a while.  It's by the same dude who did SimCity and the Sims, yada yada, if you want to know all that you can check out the <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=18029" target="_blank">myriad gaming articles</a> out there who care a lot more about the particulars than I do.  The main thing of interest to me is the creature creator at this point, since Maxis just released a <a href="http://www.spore.com/trial" target="_blank">demo version</a> of it.  You can also buy a non-disabled version for $10 (digitally starting at noon CST today).  The demo version limits the variety of parts you can add pretty significantly.  What it does let you see is how well it animates and interprets the morphology of the creatures you make.  And it's pretty frickin' cool.</p>

Below is one of my creations, Otzertzen.
